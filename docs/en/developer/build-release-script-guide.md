# Release Build Script Guide (`build_release.bat`)

## Overview

`build_release.bat` is a script used to automate the building of the Project Remis portable release package. It is responsible for cleaning up old build files, creating a new directory structure, embedding the Python environment, copying project source code, downloading and packaging all dependencies, and finally generating a distributable ZIP archive.

## Features

*   **Automated Build**: One-click completion of the portable release package build process.
*   **Environment Isolation**: Packages the Python runtime environment and all dependencies into the release package, eliminating the need for users to manually install Python or configure the environment.
*   **Dependency Management**: Automatically downloads all Python dependencies defined in `requirements.txt` and places them in the `packages` directory.
*   **Structured Output**: Generates a release package that conforms to the Project Remis portable directory structure.
*   **Optional Compression**: If 7-Zip is installed on the system, the script will automatically compress the generated release directory into a ZIP file.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1.  **Conda Environment**: The script assumes it is run within an activated Conda/Python environment. Please ensure Conda is installed on your system and that the `CONDA_ROOT` and `ENV_NAME` variables are correctly configured in the script.
2.  **7-Zip (Optional)**: If you want the script to automatically generate a ZIP archive, please ensure 7-Zip is installed on your system and its executable (`7z.exe`) is in the system PATH or a default path the script can find.
3.  **Python Embeddable Package**: Ensure that the `python-3.10.11-embed-amd64.zip` file exists in the `archive/build_release_scripts/` directory.

### Running the Script

1.  **Activate Conda Environment**:
    Open a command-line tool (e.g., Anaconda Prompt) and activate the Conda environment you are using for building:
    ```bash
    conda activate your_env_name
    ```
    (Please replace `your_env_name` with the environment name defined in the script's `ENV_NAME` variable)

2.  **Execute the Build Script**:
    Navigate to the `archive/build_release_scripts/` directory, then run `build_release.bat`:
    ```bash
    cd J:\V3_Mod_Localization_Factory\archive\build_release_scripts\
    build_release.bat
    ```

3.  **Wait for Completion**:
    The script will automatically execute all build steps. Detailed log information will be output during the process. Please wait patiently until the script displays `[SUCCESS] Build process completed!`.

## Script Configuration

You can modify the following variables at the beginning of the `build_release.bat` script:

*   `CONDA_ROOT`: Your Conda installation root directory.
*   `ENV_NAME`: The name of the Conda environment used for building.
*   `PROJECT_NAME`: Project name (defaults to `Project_Remis`).
*   `VERSION`: Release version number (defaults to `1.1.0`).

## Build Process Overview

1.  **Initialization**: Determine the project root directory, release directory name, and path.
2.  **Cleanup**: Delete the previously generated release directory (if it exists).
3.  **Scaffolding**: Create the new release directory structure (`app`, `packages`, `python-embed`).
4.  **Python Embedding**: Extract the embeddable Python environment from the ZIP package to the `python-embed` directory.
5.  **Copy Source Code**: Copy core files such as `scripts`, `data`, `docs`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, `README_EN.md`, `LICENSE`, `banner.txt` to the `app` directory.
6.  **Create Empty Directories**: Create necessary empty directories like `logs`, `my_translation`, `source_mod` under the `app` directory.
7.  **Copy Installation Scripts**: Copy `setup.bat` and `get-pip.py` to the release directory and embeddable Python directory.
8.  **Activate Conda Environment**: Activate the specified Conda environment to execute the `pip download` command.
9.  **Package Dependencies**: Use the `pip download` command to download all dependencies defined in `requirements.txt` to the `packages` directory of the release package.
10. **Copy Run Script**: Copy `run.bat` to the release directory.
11. **Final Packaging (Optional)**: If 7-Zip is detected, the entire release directory will be compressed into a ZIP file.

## Troubleshooting

*   **`tar` command not found**: Ensure `tar` is installed on your system, or manually extract `python-3.10.11-embed-amd64.zip`.
*   **`python.exe` not found**: Check if `python-3.10.11-embed-amd64.zip` is corrupted or if the path is correct.
*   **`pip download` failed**: Check the `pip_log.txt` file for detailed error messages, ensure network connectivity, and that the Conda environment is correctly activated.
*   **`7z.exe` not found**: If 7-Zip is not installed, the script will skip the automatic compression step, and you will need to manually compress the release directory.
