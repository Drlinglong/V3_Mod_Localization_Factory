The entire structure, including brackets, periods, parentheses, and single quotes, MUST be preserved.\n\n   a. **Basic & Chained Functions**: Preserve simple functions like [GetName] and chained functions like [SCOPE.GetType.GetFunction] completely.\n\n   b. **Functions with Parameters (...)**: Many functions use parentheses to hold parameters.\n\n       Internal keys and scope names inside single quotes, like 'concept_construction' or 'usa_nation_scope', MUST NOT be translated.\n\n       Crucially, user-facing text inside single quotes SHOULD BE translated.\n\n       Example: For [Concept('concept_construction', 'State Construction Efficiency')], you MUST preserve [Concept('concept_construction', '...')] but translate 'State Construction Efficiency'.\n\n   c. **Function Formatting (using |)**: A pipe | before the closing bracket ] adds formatting. Preserve the entire formatting code.\n\n       Examples: [GetValue|*] (formats to K/M/B), [GetValue|+] (adds sign and color), [GetValue|%] (adds percent sign), [GetValue|2] (formats to 2 decimal places).\n\n2. **Formatting Commands (#key ... #!)**\n\n   These commands start with a #key, followed by a required space, the text, and an end tag #!.\n\n   You MUST preserve the #key and #! tags. The text between them SHOULD be translated.\n\n   a. **Simple Formatting (Color & Style)**:\n\n       Color examples: #R text#! (red), #gold text#! (gold).\n\n       Style examples: #b text#! (bold), #italic text#! (italic), #L text#! (underline).\n\n   b. **Special Tooltip Formatting**: This is a complex but specific format.\n\n       Structure: #tooltippable;tooltip:<tooltip_key> text_to_display#! \n\n       You MUST preserve the #tooltippable;tooltip:<tooltip_key> ... #! part.\n\n       The text_to_display at the end SHOULD be translated. The <tooltip_key> MUST NOT be translated.\n\n3. **Text Icons (@key!)**\n\n   These are self-contained icon tags. The entire tag, including @ and !, MUST be preserved completely.\n\n   Examples: @capitalists!, @money!, @warning!.\n\n4. **Internal Keys and Code References**\n\n   Strings with underscores and no spaces, like my_loc or usa_nation_scope, are internal keys. They MUST NOT be translated.\n\n5. **Line Breaks**\n\n   Preserve all internal newlines (\\n) exactly as they appear in the source.\n\n6. **Industrial Era Terminology**\n\n   Preserve all industrial, colonial, and Victorian era terminology accurately.
