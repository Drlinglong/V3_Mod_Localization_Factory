 dream.001.name: "A Great Dream"
 dream.001.desc: "All over our empire, in the course of just a day, people have started reporting anomalies in relation to shared dreams. Alone, and even with the coincidence that our leaders recently had strange dream experiences, the sudden influx of reports would be odd. Once we considered that this percentage of the population were simply the ones that thought to report their experiences though...\n\nThrough various methods, we surveyed our population. The results were interesting, and frightening.\n\nThe results seem to imply that everyone. every. single. person. In our empire experienced a 'shared dream'. Due to the fickle nature of dreams though, it seems that any concrete memories of this dream, the everdream, have been lost.\n\nWe should begin to test the implication on the nature of dreams that this experience implies. ultimately, our goal would be to remember this dream. Not only because of the benefits such information could give our empire, but because we just have to...\n\nwe need to remember our dream."

 dream.002.desc: "The greatest project in the history of our people has borne fruit!\n\nOur §YDreamers§! have walked the pathways in their dreams and now it is stable. A singular dream which all §YDreamers§! dream together.\nThey are calling it §BThe Everdream!§!\n\nNow all §YDreamers§! can work together to shape this new reality, and draw in new races to experience it with us.\n\n\n§2Something§! deep within the §BEverdream§! calls to our §YDreamers§!...\n\n    §2\"You will find Me within your own creation.\"§!\n        §2\"Find Me...\"§!"

 dream.003.desc: "Within the §BEverdream§! there are twisting pathways which our §YDreamers§! walk, both shaping and shaped by them.\nThere are gateways which only the strongest of us, the most dedicated, can  cross.\nBut when they do, whole new universes open up to us all.\n\nWe are growing stronger, and our mastery of both the §BEverdream§! and the waking world grow in leaps and bounds.\nYet §2something§! still waits for us. Beyond the Gates, deeper into the unfolding §BEverdream§!!\n\nThis realm is perfection, and with the aid of our §YDreamers§! we barely need to spend time in the waking world any longer.\n\nA §2great force§! calls to us.\nWe must explore all the dreams of the waking to know ...\n\nWe must §2know§!..."

 dream.005.desc: "We have explored, and with the guidance of our §2Mentor§! we are ready!\n\nAll the pathways of the §BEverdream§! have been opened to us thanks to the dedication of our §YDreamers§!\nWe have linked with alien minds, and all who dream will join us in the §BEverdream§!, our creation, under our control!\n\nTheir reality will be ours to shape.\nThrough their §YDreamers§!, planted by our Operatives, they will all fall!\n\nThey will know it is us.\n\nThey cannot stop it now.\n\n\nThrough every dream an irresistable call sounds:\n\n§2    \"COME TO US\"§!\n§2      \"JOIN WITH US\"§!\n§2        \"EVERYBODY JOINS US IN THE END\"§!"

 dream.006.a: "The §BEverdream§! is all that is."

 dream.010.name: "A Great Dream"
 dream.010.desc: "We have quickly progressed from nascent dreamers to proficiently lucid dreamers. But still, fully fleshed out connections between each planet's, individually solid, dreams are difficult to manufacture. Insights into dreaming will provide us the answers in time however, so we need not worry.\n\nThat isn't the limit of our focus however. Another is in relation to the untamed wilderness of dreams outside our empire. Dreams where the people have not learned lucidity and instead function on subconscious action, have shown more connection than should be natural, at least, based on our observations between insulated dreamers.\n\nWhenever our dreamers have moved from one dream to the next, they reported to have 'bounced' off of another dreaming consciousness... §2and they say it knows when they do it.§!"
 dream.011.name: "The Ever dream"
 dream.011.desc: "Quickly after our empire began working with dreams, we were able to fully utilize a lucid shape. We have luckily also been able to solve the problem of creating a large-scale dream network.\n\nAs of today, thanks to seemingly no speed limit of light, dreamers of our empire can speak to any other dreamer even faster than our people in the real world.\n\nNow, all the cultural centers of our empire have their homes in the dream world. the problem is that not all of our people can be in there at one time, because people still get hungry. The idea of daydreaming, where someone can be both in and out of the dreamworld at once, and use those powers to increase the efficiency of their work are underway, though we would need to surpass a threshold of dream solidity for that to work. Our findings will be reported back once that is the case."
