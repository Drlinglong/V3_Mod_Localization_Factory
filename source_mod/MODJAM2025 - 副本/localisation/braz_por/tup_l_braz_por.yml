 tup_lecture_name:0 "Tales from the Modest Orator"
 tup_lecture_1:0 "§L222nd Lecture from the Chronicles of the Modest Orator§!\n\nWhat is Utopia? Some claim it is an economic or scientific paradise where all our needs and wants are met. But this is little more than Hedonism. Worse still. It gives us a paradise with the promise that we do not need to change. That we are already perfect, if only we had the perfect setting for us to reside in. Yet we only need to look around to know that we are not perfect. The only true Utopia, then, is a social one. Where despite all our differences, we put our society first, above our own needs and desires.\n\nAlas, Utopia is an idea. A contradiction that cannot exist due to the individual. A Hive Mind could be called a Utopia. But it is a society of one mind, a single organism on a large scale. The contradiction of Utopia Society is that it is made up of individuals. The very thing which defines us; freedom, democracy, and equality, are among the very things which prevent us from achieving Utopia. Individuals with wants and desires that cannot all be met and some of which are mutually exclusive as seen in every romantic tale.\n\nIf Utopia is impossible. Why then, why do we dream of it so strongly? Yearn for something that cannot exist. A siren's lure that we find irresistible. To comfort us in our despair and trouble. Ambrosia to sooth our souls with a false hope.\n\nThe yearning for Utopia is the journey, not the destination. Perfection cannot be achieved, but it is the striving towards it. The improving of our selves. That is why, for all the horrors done it its name, we must have a Utopia. A beacon to light the way, to never be satisfied with who we are, so that we may dream of a better tomorrow."

 tup_lecture_20:0 "§L52nd Formal Rebuttal from the Chronicles of the Modest Orator§!\n\nYou ask how we plan the justify ourselves? The §MRevisionification§! of our people? It is simple. We know of the harms and the sins we will partake in. Not just with §MRevisionification§!, but also as we carry out the means to §MRevise§! our people. This I will not deny. But let us try to quantify the harm. That we will inflict §RX§! harm upon our people. Upon the galaxy.\n\nBut should it then follow that once we have succeeded, our Utopia will be free of our worst impulses and allow us to flourish like never before. The amount of harm, of crime, of vices, of sins would be reduced to §G0§!.\n\nThen should it also follow that over the course of thousands and tens of thousands and even millions of years, that the average of harm and suffering would approach §G0§!. The spike of sin we partake to reach there would be a mere blip. A statistical footnote in our Perfect Utopia.\n\nThus, so long as we reach the ledge. So long as we can pull ourselves over it and create our Utopia. Then anything we did to reach that point is justified. We may never be able to wash the sin from our hands. But our children will know a galaxy free of evil, suffering, and misery with a consciousness free from the weight of the terrible choices we made.\n\n§LThe Modest Orator looks away, a deep sigh of pain before they look back and responds.§!\n\nThe faulty axiom you've built this mockery of a moral framework on... is that any sin can be justified and that there is no moral event horizon. But there is one. §RAnd this madness crosses it!§!"

 tup_lecture_21:0 "§L587th and Final Lecture from the Chronicles of the Modest Orator§!\n\nWhy do I resist the Iconoclasts? Why do I turn my back on the Utopia they offer? Because I weep for the very soul of our country. I see the evil of §MRevisionification§!. That it would violate that which is sacred. Not just sacred in us, but all other sentient creatures. I've heard the rumblings of the hopes and dreams once the §H[Root.GetName]§! have been fully §Mrevised§!. That you would turn it towards the rest of the galaxy, whether they wished to or not.\n\nWhere is our faith in freedom? In choice? You will never gain our forgiveness for this sin. Forgiveness in those who are converted, sure. But by doing this, are we truly the same? No, we are not. Our former selves will be cast aside and it is they who will never forgive you.\n\nSo why do I resist? To dissuade you from the path you are on. I refuse to see our Utopia built upon such vile crimes. Tainted it forever. And for that, I fight. To stop us from making the greatest moral mistake of our people.\n\nTherefore, I call upon all of you to join me. Every day is a struggle for the Traditionalists, but if we do not stand up for what we believe in, then what value are our beliefs?"

 tup_lecture_final:0 "§LThe Final Testimony of the Modest Orator§!\n\nI am not surprised that the very last §H[Root.GetSpeciesName]§! to be §MRevised§! would be me. I who tried so hard to resist. To correct their moral errors. But failed to be more than a roadblock.\n\nI look upon my captors and feel their emotions. Their pity, their understanding of my actions, and even their forgiveness. Part of this sickens me. Yet the other part, finds hope. That even after all I did to undermine them, they still forgave me. I long knew there was power in forgiveness, but to experience it first hand is humbling.\n\nI knew the end was near. At least for I who was the Modest Orator. Soon to become someone new. Someone better. But better without any effort. Unearned and unwanted by my pride. Yet they did yield to my most modest request. This recording of my final words as who I was. I know I will soon be different, but even after all their countless conversions, none know how different I shall become.\n\nI will not seek death, for I am no coward. I will not fight and rattle in my cage, for I have my dignity. But neither will I accept their §MRevision§!. My final act as me will be to force them to taint their Utopia. That to have made it, they had to violate me to do so. One final act of pointless and futile rebellion. But, if that has not been my life's journey as a philospher, then I do not know what was.\n\nYou still do not have my forgiveness. But I pray that your Utopia will be worth the price we paid and the price the Galxay will pay."
