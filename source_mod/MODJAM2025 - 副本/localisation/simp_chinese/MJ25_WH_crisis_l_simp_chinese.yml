 MJ25_WH_whispers.2061.desc: "...\n\n...\n\n...We believe so. It took forcefully severing our connection as it spiralled beyond our control, but we are here. Whole of mind, if just barely. We simply did not expect to feel such... weight during a simple dive into the consciousness of a younger race.\n\nBut make no mistake, this was a failing of our ritual and nothing more. All we can say is that your path leads to a dead end. We would strongly urge you not to waste your time or energy on such things when more worldly concerns abound.\n\n\nThere is a sense of urgency to their tone."
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2061.a: "We have other questions."

All we can tell you is that there is no grand Truth to discover amongst the stars, and that nothing good can come of such naive pursuits.\n\nBelieve us. Please.\n\nNow, we must retire.

You do not need to look far to find records of such empires.\n\nBut that isn't what you are asking about, is it? You wish to know of others who follow the same path you do, who question the place of what they hear. If it is true that your echoes are not born of the Shroud... Then no records of such empires exist.\n\nIn this, you are alone."

 MJ25_WH_whispers.2071.desc: "Certainly. Other realms sit interleaved both above and beneath our own dimension. The Shroud is but one - the deepest of the layers of the mind. While it is the most likely source for a being capable of the feats you have mentioned, there are other deep-seated realms that touch our own.\n\nPlanes of torment, of energy, of matter... There are more than we can know. To search them all would take an eternity, and we confess that we are experts only in matters of the Shroud."
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2071.a: "What of the others who walked this path?"
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2071.b: "What do you know of the Truth?"

There are those who once possessed a mastery of the laws of the universe, and even they did not so boldly claim that the rest of us lived in such ignorance.\n\nYes, our world is filled with wondrous secrets, but even the greatest of these does not invalidate what we have already learnt. Rather than chase such impossibilities, you should seek to find your own place in the universe."

 MJ25_WH.1202.desc: "Our songflares have recently reached the border of a Fallen Empire, the §H[From.GetSpeciesName]§!. Rather than be receptive to the epiphany we promise, they have taken the stance that we are an existential threat that must be eliminated.\n\nAs our song descends upon their systems, a flurry of activity not seen in our histories has come over the empire. They who once slept have awakened once more, and it is with hatred and a lack of understanding in their hearts that they now look towards our works.\n\nWar may well await..."
 MJ25_WH.1202.a: "We must bolster our defenses."

 MJ25_WH.1203.title: "They Who Would Silence Us"
 MJ25_WH.1203.desc: "As we had expected, the §H[From.GetSpeciesName]§! simply could not be moved by our every insistence that we fight to bring the Truth to all. Vowing to crush us into the dirt and silence our voices forevermore, they have declared total war against us.\n\nWe would invite them to join us in song, but alas, our elders prove too close-minded.

Not only to our team, but to all of us. One wrong step could change all that we are.\n\nWithin this vast conceptual space, one of [from.leader.GetName]'s underlings has erred. Consumed by a moment of uncontrolled fear, they find themselves scattered across countless of our people' minds. The understudy is already lost to us, but the echoes of their end threaten those into whom their shards have become lodged.\n\nAs they are drawn in turn to the brink of collapse, we will have to act quickly to extract these shattered fragments if we are to preserve their lives."
 MJ25_WH_sites.461.hivemind.desc:0 "We tread lightly within the depths of our collective unconsciousness. Even with how careful we are being, however, there is great risk involved. We are within our self, beyond the limits of our understanding. A mind, even so vast as ours, can easily be broken, and one wrong step could change all that we are.\n\nWithin this vast conceptual space, one of our processes has grown aberrant. Consumed by a moment of uncontrolled terror dredged up from the depths of our primal instincts, that tendril of our thoughts scatters across our vaster mind. We recoil, steeling ourselves against that lethal fear. As the edges of our mind begin to crumble, we quickly plunge those poisonous thoughts into nearby drones and sever them from our whole.\n\nIt is never easy to amputate a part of our self. But here, it was necessary."

A roiling shudder passes through, rearranging the space itself. [from.leader.GetName] stumbles, brushing against one of the shimmering filaments.\n\nA psychic pulse rips through us, tearing thought into vaporous shrapnel. The discomfort passes quickly, but we fear that the most vulnerable amongst us will not be so lucky."

With so much of our self already poured into them, it is easy for the spark of their will to draw more of our far-reaching experiences into their comparatively small being.\n\nTheir hungry mind laps it up, growing ever more labyrinthine. We give them more latitude to grow, allowing them greater access to our whole to allow them to survive the influx.\n\nWhat they are becoming will no doubt help them to see their journey through to its end.

And yet... it remains stable.\n\nUpon investigating the matter, we have come to the only possible conclusion. [fromfrom.leader.GetName] still lives, in a way. In the moment of their physical death, their mind must have latched onto that of another of our scientists in a desperate bid to see their task completed."
