 MJ25_WH.1060.desc: "On [target.GetName], the inevitable has come to pass. In a frenzied chorus, the planet's population rose up and as one called to Their glory. The skies opened, lambent with the impossibility of Their presence, and in an instant, every communication transmitted from our colony ceased.\n\nDistant outposts reported a thunderous rumble, and in the moments to follow, registered the disappearance of the planet. In a heartbeat, a cracking refraction spread over the planet as it folded in upon itself and vanished.\n\nOf its people, there is no trace save echoes lingering upon solar winds."

 MJ25_WH.1160.desc: "Rules are meant to be broken, and those defining reality are no different. If Their song has taught us anything, it is that our songs may reshape the world around us.\n\nIn imbuing our ships' components with the screaming will, we may break through the most fundamental elements of reality. To do so is no trivial task, and each of these transformations grows more difficult than the last. However, it is by such an exercise that we may create tools of the utmost potential.\n\nWe must now decide to what ends we shall apply our songs. Which tool, we ask, shall we dream into being?"

 MJ25_WH.1170.materialist.desc: "[Root.GetSpeciesName], cease and desist in your attempts to sow confusion amongst our fleets. We are aware that you have caused several incidents already, and our patience for your antics grows thin. We understand far more than you ever will, and these claims of whispers do not fit any moderately acceptable universal theorem. Ergo, they are false."

What you are spreading is not simply false, but malicious. Might we recommend conciliation rather than aggression before it is too late for you?"
 MJ25_WH.1170.xenophobe.desc: "Your attempts to coopt our fleets mean little, [Root.GetSpeciesName]. Already, we have countered your primitive technology and dismissed your rudimentary understanding of the universe as laughable. Now get lost and bother us no more."
 MJ25_WH.1170.machine.desc: "Custodian protocol 727-9 activated. Message follows: Attention, [Root.GetSpeciesName]. The transmissions that we have received from your empire consist of infections scrapcode. We have calculated that your empire is 72% §R<<ERROR: DATA BLOCK CORRUPTED>>§!. We request that you validate your systems and have erected a firewall to prevent further spread into our experiential matrix."
 MJ25_WH.1170.hive.desc: "We have heard your whispers itching at old scars. It is a discomfort, but one that a mind like ours can easily drown out. Do not doubt that screams are far louder than mere whispers, and we are no strangers to those."

 MJ25_WH.1170.a: "They no longer hear us."
 MJ25_WH.1170.a.tt: "Fleets owned by the [event_target:MJ25_WH_temp_fe.GetName] have become immune to the §Y$MJ25_WH_conductor_confusion_menu_title$§! ability of our Conductors."
 
 MJ25_WH.1202.title: "They Who Will Not Hear"
 MJ25_WH.1202.desc: "Our songflares have recently reached the border of a Fallen Empire, the §H[From.GetSpeciesName]§!. Rather than be receptive to the epiphany we promise, they have taken the stance that we are an existential threat that must be eliminated.\n\nAs our song descends upon their systems, a flurry of activity not seen in our histories has come over the empire. They who once slept have awakened once more, and it is with hatred and a lack of understanding in their hearts that they now look towards our works.\n\nWar may well await..."
 MJ25_WH.1202.a: "We must bolster our defenses."

 MJ25_WH.1203.title: "They Who Would Silence Us"
 MJ25_WH.1203.desc: "As we had expected, the §H[FromFrom.GetSpeciesName]§! simply could not be moved by our every insistence that we fight to bring the Truth to all. Vowing to crush us into the dirt and silence our voices forevermore, they have declared total war against us.\n\nWe would invite them to join us in song, but alas, our elders prove too close-minded. It is a shame, certainly, but we shall do as we must. This can end only one way."
 MJ25_WH.1203.a: "We fight for the Truth."
