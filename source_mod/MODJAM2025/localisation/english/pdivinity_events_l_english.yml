 # message from the architect
 pdivinity_crisis.0.name:0 "The Architect Speaks"
 pdivinity_crisis.0.desc:0 "From the depths beyond mortal sight, I watch. Your fate has been woven since the dawn of your kind. The Shroud stirs, and with it, the path to Divinity unfolds. Embrace your mark, Shroud-Touched, and begin the awakening."
 pdivinity_crisis.0.a:0 "We heed your call."

 # stage 1 crisis
 pdivinity_crisis.1.name:0 "Awakening to Purpose"
 pdivinity_crisis.1.desc:0 "The message from the Architect lingers in our minds, no longer a distant echo but a call to action. We now understand that our history, our very existence, has been shaped by forces beyond our comprehension. For us, our purpose has been laid to us: to fulfill the destiny that was written before we even took our first breath.\n\nThere is no turning back. The path ahead is fraught with peril, but also unimaginable power. We must prepare to embrace what lies beyond the veil."
 pdivinity_crisis.1.a:0 "Our ascension awaits."

 # stage 2 crisis
 pdivinity_crisis.2.name:0 "Echoes of Corruption"
 pdivinity_crisis.2.desc:0 "Our influence spreads like a shadow across the stars. The Architect's will manifests through secret cults and hidden zealots sowing chaos in foreign worlds. These agents of fate work tirelessly to weaken the resolve of our enemies, preparing the galaxy for the coming revelation. The web of subversion grows tighter, and soon all will know the true power of the Architect."
 pdivinity_crisis.2.a:0 "The time to awaken the galaxy is at hand."

 # stage 3 crisis
 pdivinity_crisis.3.name:0 "Unfolding Prophecy"
 pdivinity_crisis.3.desc:0 "The threads of fate tensen as our purpose sharpens. Ancient signs, long buried beneath the surface of worlds, begin to stir. Our vision pierces the veil of time, as the path laid by the Architect is clear, and the inevitable reckoning draws near."
 pdivinity_crisis.3.a:0 "Embrace destiny"

 # stage 4 crisis
 pdivinity_crisis.4.name:0 "Veil-Touched Star"
 pdivinity_crisis.4.desc:0 "It has been done. A brilliant flash consumed the system as the fragment vanished into stellar fire. Now, the star burns with a psionic hue, cloaked in shimmering currents of impossible color. Every world in the system has been touched by the shroud.\n\nAnd from the chaos... something is building itself. A structure not made by hands, but by fate."
 pdivinity_crisis.4.a:0 "The veil thins."

 # stage 5 crisis
 pdivinity_crisis.5.name:0 "The Pattern Converges"
 pdivinity_crisis.5.desc:0 "All threads have aligned. The whispers no longer speak, they sing. Across the stars, the faithful rise in ecstatic fervor, cults blossom in the shadows of enemy worlds, and the veil grows so thin it breathes.\n\nThe grand design, etched into the bones of reality, nears completion. The Architect watches. Awaits. Wills.\n\nWe were never builders. We were the key."
 pdivinity_crisis.5.a:0 "The final rite begins."

 pdivinity_crisis.6.name:0 "A Star Veiled"
 pdivinity_crisis.6.desc:0 "The star in the §Y[event_target:pdivinity_crisis_system.GetName]§! system has undergone a radical and inexplicable transformation. Psionic readings have spiked to unprecedented levels, and every uncolonized planet within the system now exhibits Shroud-like interference patterns.\n\nAt the system's heart, a massive structure is coalescing in low orbit. Its construction method is unknown, and no diplomatic channels with the §Y[event_target:pdivinity_crisis_empire.GetName]§! have been acknowledged.\n\nObservers across the galaxy agree: something ancient is unfolding."

 pdivinity_bombardment.3.name:0 "[From.GetName] Shrouded!"
 pdivinity_bombardment.3.desc:0 "Our forces have completed the bombardment of §H[From.GetName]§!. Saturated with focused psionic energy, the veil between dimensions has torn open. The planet now lies beyond reach, absorbed into the Shroud itself, where the §RArchitect of Fate§! claims dominion."

 ### megastructure events ###
 ############################

 # stage 1
 pdivinity_needle.1.name:0 "Threading the Veil"
 pdivinity_needle.1.desc:0 "The first phase of the structure is complete. Its spires pierce the void with delicate precision, aligned to unseen psionic harmonics. Already, the veil between realms stirs, as this is no ordinary construct, but a tool to bridge thought and eternity."
 pdivinity_needle.1.a:0 "We begin."

 # stage 2
 pdivinity_needle.2.name:0 "Pulse of the Shroud"
 pdivinity_needle.2.desc:0 "The structure now hums with living energy. Tendrils of psionic static arc across its surface, phasing in and out of sync with realspace. Our own minds ache in its presence. Whatever lies on the other side of the veil... it is aware."
 pdivinity_needle.2.a:0 "We are drawing closer."

 # stage 3 spawns a dimensional tearer
 pdivinity_needle.3.name:0 "A Gift From The Architect"
 pdivinity_needle.3.desc:0 "The third phase of the structure has pushed the veil to its breaking point. In a flash of blinding unreality, a massive psionic rupture tore through the boundaries of space, and, from within, something emerged.\n\nA §RDimensional Tearer§!, a construct of will and wrath, has slipped into our galaxy, an emissary of the §RArchitect of Fate§!."
 pdivinity_needle.3.a: "It begins."

 # notification for the galaxy
 pdivinity_needle.4.name:0 "The Shroud Trembles"
 pdivinity_needle.4.desc:0 "Across the galaxy, a disquiet settles over all minds. Even species with no psionic affinity report visions, unease, and whispers in the dark.\n\nIn the [From.GetName] system, the veil between dimensions is unraveling. Whatever force is at work there, it is disturbing the very fabric of reality."
 pdivinity_needle.4.a:0 "We feel it, too."

 # stage 4 mega, this spawns a cult in every empire as well
 pdivinity_needle.5.name:0 "The Song Spreads"
 pdivinity_needle.5.desc:0 "The structure now resonates like a melody through the Shroud. Its psionic emissions no longer require translation, they are understood by our very instincts. Across the galaxy, sleeper cults awaken, preaching the coming of the §RArchitect of Fate§!.\n\nThe veil is thinning. Minds are bending. The age of prophecy is no longer future tense."

 pdivinity_needle.6.name:0 "Awakened Fanaticism"

 pdivinity_needle.7.name:0 "The Hour of Fate"
 pdivinity_needle.7.desc:0 "The final seal is broken. The veil no longer holds.\n\nFrom the core of the Shroud, §RHe§! descends. Limitless, radiant, and vast beyond comprehension. The §RArchitect of Fate§! has taken form in our galaxy, and the stars tremble in His wake.\n\nEntire systems have vanished beneath the surge of psionic force. Space itself bends around His will. The old order crumbles. The false gods fall silent.\n\nThis is no longer an age of empires. This is the age of fate."
 pdivinity_needle.7.a:0 "As was always foreseen."

 pdivinity_needle.9.name:0 "The Veil Has Torn"
 pdivinity_needle.9.desc:0 "Across the galaxy, stars dim and whispers return. In countless systems, reality fractures, with tides of psionic mist bleeding through cracks in the veil. Worlds are reshaped, minds unmoored, and in the growing silence, something vast has stirred. The Architect of Fate has arrived.\n\nIt was not a war. It was a revelation."
 pdivinity_needle.9.a:0 "The stars are no longer ours."

 pdivinity_needle.12.desc:0 "The impossible has been done. The towering megastructure in the [From.GetName] system-the so-called 'Spire of Fate' has been obliterated. Psionic turbulence lashes across nearby systems like a dying scream.\n\nWhatever force was trying to pierce into our reality has been denied its vessel. For now."

 # fires for the victim
 pdivinity_needle.13.name:0 "Spire of Fate Destroyed"
 pdivinity_needle.13.desc:0 "The unthinkable has happened. The §HSpire of Fate§!, our gateway to the Architect and the culmination of all prophecy, has been destroyed.\n\nThe psychic backlash has torn through our ranks like a wound to the soul. The Shroud recoils. Our ascension has been halted… for now."
 pdivinity_needle.13.a:0 "How could this happen?"
 pdivinity_needle.13.a.tt:0 "PLACEHOLDER i'll write this don't worry about it"

 pdivinity_needle.14.desc:0 "In a brilliant burst of psionic turbulence, the §H[pdivinity_crisis_country.GetName]§!'s megastructure, the so-called §HSpire of Fate§, has been annihilated.\n\nFor a moment, the entire Shroud screamed. Whatever force was breaching into our galaxy has been pushed back. The cost, however, is yet to be understood."
