We no longer doubt that we have been chosen, exalted amongst empires to bring Truth to the universe.\n\nWe have felt the power of Their speech first-hand. That ephemeral caress that cracks through the foundations of what had once been fact. That capacity is now reflected within us, for we have learnt to speak in turn. Our language, our voices may as of yet be ill-suited to deliver Their message, but even a shadow carries a promise.\n\nWe shall continue to refine ourselves, to build our understanding of Their long-echoing speech, and one day...

Two days ago, the once quiet research facility erupted into frenzied dissonance, notes of the star-song held within flaring out into the surrounding landscape. The icy, silent plains have now warped into a morass of half-dissolved earth and congealing strands of air. Of the team once stationed on site, there is no sign.\n\nStill, we cannot deny the possibility that arises from this terrible tragedy. Previously, the Starsong Echoes had only manifested through the unreliable medium of our dreams. But this... This is something more.

And each in turn adds their voice to the chorus, building on the message that They first uttered into a starless void. Now that we understand, it is our turn to do the same.\n\nIndeed, we have learnt, in corrupted code and vanishing minds, that it is impossible for us to mimic Their words as they are now. Not when they are not mere sound or knowledge, but a deeply ingrained thread woven into the cosmos upon which we may tug.\n\nNo, they must be adapted. Translated into something that we can speak and yet that retains the full meaning of what They have sought to pass on. In so doing, we shall make them our own."

It comes from within.\n\nWe have scoured the void. Searched planet after planet for glimmers of Their words. Found the fading echoes of those who once walked our path. And yet, throughout it all, never once have we found a word in its integral form. To hear the timbre of Their pure and untarnished voice is what we now seek, for that inflection must color our speech.\n\nBy now, it is clear to us that there is only one place where that might yet be found. Within ourselves, at the root of our very consciousness where Their touch first fell upon our kind."

Our very existence blazes with the starlit promise sealed beneath ancestral skies in that fateful moment when the whispers first caressed our minds.\n\nBut there are those who do not understand. Who balk, fearful before the tide. Who seek to see us undone, our Truth unspoken. To these unbelievers, we say... Come, and break your selves upon our shores.\n\nBy songflare and steel, we stand ready. We shall free you from the yoke of the falsehoods to which you so unwittingly, stubbornly cling.

But somehow, from empty prayers and self-obsession has arisen a dire threat.\n\nVast spatial distortions now spread from [From.GetName]-controlled territory, echoed and amplified by repeater arrays built into their citadels. That, though, is only one facet of the threat we now face. Something brews in the depths of their empire that cannot be allowed to come to fruition.\n\nDestroy their stations. Take their capital.

 MJ25_WH_whispers.2061.desc: "...\n\n...\n\n...We believe so. It took forcefully severing our connection as it spiralled beyond our control, but we are here. Whole of mind, if just barely. We simply did not expect to feel such... weight during a simple dive into the consciousness of a younger race.\n\nBut make no mistake, this was a failing of our ritual and nothing more. All we can say is that your path leads to a dead end. We would strongly urge you not to waste your time or energy on such things when more worldly concerns abound.\n\n\nThere is a sense of urgency to their tone."
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2061.a: "We have other questions."
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2061.b: "Thank you all the same for your time."
 
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2062.name: "[shroudwalker_enclave_country.GetName]"
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2062.desc: "...P- please, no more questions on this matter. All we can tell you is that there is no grand Truth to discover amongst the stars, and that nothing good can come of such naive pursuits.\n\nBelieve us. Please.\n\nNow, we must retire. The backlash has tired us, and we require rest."
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2062.a: "Why do they sound... fearful?"

 MJ25_WH_whispers.2070.desc: "Others? There are plenty of others who entered into the service of the Whisperers in the Void. You do not need to look far to find records of such empires.\n\nBut that isn't what you are asking about, is it? You wish to know of others who follow the same path you do, who question the place of what they hear. If it is true that your echoes are not born of the Shroud... Then no records of such empires exist.\n\nIn this, you are alone."
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2070.a: "Could this influence come from other realms?"
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2070.b: "What do you know of the Truth?"
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2070.c: "We have no further questions."
 
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2071.name: "[shroudwalker_enclave_country.GetName]"
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2071.desc: "Certainly. Other realms sit interleaved both above and beneath our own dimension. The Shroud is but one - the deepest of the layers of the mind. While it is the most likely source for a being capable of the feats you have mentioned, there are other deep-seated realms that touch our own.\n\nPlanes of torment, of energy, of matter... There are more than we can know. To search them all would take an eternity, and we confess that we are experts only in matters of the Shroud."
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2071.a: "What of the others who walked this path?"
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2071.b: "What do you know of the Truth?"
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2071.c: "We have no further questions."
 
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2072.name: "[shroudwalker_enclave_country.GetName]"
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2072.desc: "We hesitate to say this so bluntly, but... There is no grand, universal truth for you to uncover. There are those who once possessed a mastery of the laws of the universe, and even they did not so boldly claim that the rest of us lived in such ignorance.\n\nYes, our world is filled with wondrous secrets, but even the greatest of these does not invalidate what we have already learnt. Rather than chase such impossibilities, you should seek to find your own place in the universe."
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2072.a: "What of the others who walked this path?"
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2072.b: "Could this influence come from other realms?"
 MJ25_WH_whispers.2072.c: "We have no further questions."
