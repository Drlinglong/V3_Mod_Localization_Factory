Whether they will still exist as one of us come their journey's end yet remains to be seen."
 MJ25_WH_sites.463.hivemind.desc:0 "[from.leader.GetName] is evolving. There is no other way to put it. With so much of our self already poured into them, it is easy for the spark of their will to draw more of our far-reaching experiences into their comparatively small being.\n\nTheir hungry mind laps it up, growing ever more labyrinthine. We give them more latitude to grow, allowing them greater access to our whole to allow them to survive the influx.\n\nWhat they are becoming will no doubt help them to see their journey through to its end. We have never given so much to a single drong, however. Whether they will survive beyond their task thus remains to be seen."
 MJ25_WH_sites.463.a: "They are still fit to task."

 MJ25_WH_sites.471.desc:0 "Tragedy has struck and our anchor has been lost. Yet somehow, against all odds, [fromfrom.leader.GetName]'s team survives, adrift in the tides of our subconsciousness.\n\nBy all rights, they too should have been consumed by the collapsing dreamscape. And yet... it remains stable.\n\nUpon investigating the matter, we have come to the only possible conclusion. [fromfrom.leader.GetName] still lives, in a way. In the moment of their physical death, their mind must have latched onto that of another of our scientists in a desperate bid to see their task completed."
 MJ25_WH_sites.471.hivemind.desc:0 "Tragedy has struck and our anchor has been lost. Yet somehow, against all odds, our subconscious mindscape remains stable as we continue to ply the tides of our subconsciousness.\n\nWe already understand why, feeling a rearrangement sweep through our higher thought processes. We must have an anchor, and so we have already created another. A suitable drone has been located and filled with the shining essence of our faith, readied to continue our task. Should such an event happen again, though, we must ensure that another stands ready to take up that torch."
 MJ25_WH_sites.471.a: "They, now, are our anchor."
 MJ25_WH_sites.471.b: "Our anchor persists, clad in new flesh."

The Starsong Cradle lies quiet, beds filled with living corpses of those whose minds have been ripped asunder.\n\nOf [fromfrom.leader.GetName]'s team, there are no survivors beyond what new whispers echo through the Cradle's halls. They stood no chance. Without an anchor to channel our combined faith, the stars' song took them in mere instants.\n\nNone now remain who remember their journey. We shall have to begin it anew."
 MJ25_WH_sites.472.hivemind.desc:0 "Tragedy has struck and our anchor has been lost. The Starsong Cradle lies quiet, the subspace of our mind collapsing in upon our consciousness.\n\nTo free ourselves, we had to sever our connection to those fragments delving the abyss, even as tides of instinctive thought rushed in to shatter them. Those parts of us have been lost, although our greater self survives.\n\nIn our ascent, however, we were forced to cut loose what we had learnt, and the memories of our journey into our deepest self grow murky and indistinct. We shall have to begin anew."
