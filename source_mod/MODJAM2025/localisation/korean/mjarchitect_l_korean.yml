 mjarchitect_unlock.0.desc: "nFor a long time, there have been rumblings of some sort of voice lurking within a newly-discovered dimension dubbed §YThe Veil§!. Initially, these could be dismissed as mere rumours, but recently, many of our top scientists, researchers and politicians have reported hearing this voice themselves.\n\nWe should focus our research into The Veil in order to find the source of this voice; some even theorise that this could be the doing of an all-powerful alien entity."

 mjarchitect_unlock.5.name: "The Veil"
 mjarchitect_unlock.5.desc: "We have reached a huge development in our research of §YThe Veil§!, for better or for worse.\n\nThe so-called §YVoice Beyond the Veil§! was, in fact, real. Its source is the entity that calls itself the §HArchitect of Ruin§!. After managing to send a crude probe into The Veil, we have established permanent contact with this eldritch creature.\n\nIn fact, we have already encountered this entity's voice many times during our investigation, though we were unaware at the time. While it does not speak, we can feel its wants and emotions. It seeks communication with our leader."
 mjarchitect_unlock.5.a: "Onscreen."

 mjarchitect_unlock.10.name: "The Architect of Ruin"
 mjarchitect_unlock.10.desc: "§LNothing is heard from the other side of the probe apart from the distant screeching of an unknown origin.\n\nThick fog bellows forth from seemingly nothing. This space seems liminal; it is recognisable, yet resembles nothing.§!"

 mjarchitect_unlock.11.b: "We... understand."
 mjarchitect_unlock.11.a_reply: "§LThe Architect offers no reply, nor any respite. Anxiety fills our cognition as we struggle to speak.\n\nThen without any warning, we feel a light in the dark... Is this the power of the Architect? Despite all that may happen, perhaps there is a chance of our survival, of us thriving for eternity. As long as we take the opportunity presented to us.\n\n§MIt is not yet your time.§!\n\nWe hear the voice's words ring heavily in our minds, amidst all the emotion.\n\n§MBut it could be.§!§!"

 mjarchitect_unlock.20.desc: "There have been rumours and rumblings of a group of dissidents, loyal citizens and alien individuals all working towards one goal: total obedience to the §YArchitect of Ruin§!.\n\nIndeed, since our discovery of the eldritch being, many in our nation have developed strong feelings towards the Architect, whether positive or not.\n\nAs of today, this group has made themselves known as the §HAugurs of the Architect§!, earning enough political power and infamy to join the ranks of various political groups.\n\nIt remains to be seen if they will act positively towards our affairs, but this event represents a chance to prosper..."
 mjarchitect_unlock.20.a: "An interesting development."

 mjarchitect_unlock.25.name: "Piercing the Veil"
 mjarchitect_unlock.25.desc: "§MThe end is nigh.§!\n\nThe §YVeil§! grows ever weaker, and our resolve remains strong. We are no longer the same people we were before our covenant with the §YArchitect of Ruin§!. Through our pact, we grew capable and powerful, and now it is our turn to fulfill the agreement.\n\nPerhaps as a result of the weakening power of the Veil, in recent months there has been rising disdain for the Architect, despite all the boons we've gained from its aid. Our minds are lighter for once... is it testing us?\n\nVoices from even within the Augurs now question the fate of the galaxy, and our nation. The Architect may be the great god of our people, but perhaps gods ought not dwell in the world of mortals.\n\nNevertheless, this momentous point in history is where we will decide the §Mfate of the galaxy§!."
 mjarchitect_unlock.25.a: "The Architect has never led us astray. We will remain at its side."

 mjarchitect_unlock.35.name: "Herald of Ruin: §MSavant§!"
 mjarchitect_unlock.35.desc: "Our knowledge of the Veil and the §YArchitect of Ruin§! has developed tremendously. As more and more minds fall into line under the dominion of the Architect, our resolve grows. That seemingly-indomitable fear we were made aware of thanks to the Architect of Ruin is becoming fainter and fainter.\n\nOur minds work together for the ascension that will be brought about by the great Architect. And now, we feel yet another great urge of the Architect... and of our people.\n\nWe now know of an ancient, engimatic structure thought to have been used to open a rift into the Veil, banishing the eldritch Architect for eternity.\n\n§YIf we are to truly bring about the change we desire and progress our Crisis Level, we must locate this §HGreat Host§!§!."
 mjarchitect_unlock.35.a: "It shall be done."
 
 mjarchitect_unlock.45.name: "The Great Host"
 mjarchitect_unlock.45.desc: "At last, we have have successfully located the Great Host, as per the instructions of the Architect of Ruin. Initial surveys indicate that the megastructure itself is built around a miniscule black hole, possibly acting as a conduit for the Host.\n\nIt is currently in a decrepit state, though we theorise it can be repaired with the right knowledge, eventually. Perhaps the inner workings of the structure can be reverse-engineered, as some researchers theorise.\n\nFor now, we have completed the necessary steps given to us by our patron, allowing us to progress in our mission."
 mjarchitect_unlock.45.a: "Good work."
 
 mjarchitect_unlock.55.name: "Herald of Ruin: §MCelestial§!"
 mjarchitect_unlock.55.desc: "We have received word from the Architect of Ruin: in preparation for the final stage of our mission, it is of the utmost importance that the Great Host is in a functional state. Furthermore, it is expected that minor alterations are necessary, given that the structure was created as a one-way portal.\n\nThis is expected to take a vast amount of time, due to a large amount of the interior machinery and workings being  severely damaged. The technology behind the structure itself remains also mostly enigmatic and yet unknown to us.\n\n§YTo progress our Crisis Level, we must repair the Great Host first.§!"

 mjarchitect_unlock.70.desc: "At long last, we have successfully repaired and reawakened the Great Host in the Zenith of Ruin system. While not ready to begin the process of pulling the Architect of Ruin into our reality, it has already been able to utilise the energy of the black hole at its centre to generate a gargantuan vortex. Indeed, it appears a rift of this size is necessary for the unimaginable vastness of the Architect.\n\nSoon, we will finally be able to fulfill our end of the agreement with the Architect of Ruin. We will be rewarded handsomely, no doubt."
 mjarchitect_unlock.70.a: "Good work."
 
 # End Events
 mjarchitect_end.105.name: "The Architect Arrives"
 mjarchitect_end.105.desc: "With a deafening shriek, the Great Host began to pulse violently, shooting beams of light and miasma from the central vortex. All watching the mega-structure were blinded by a radiant light, and the minds of all sapients up to multiple hyperlanes away felt indescribably heavy, unable to process anything around them.\n\nThis is it. The Architect of Ruin... the God of the Veil.\n\nIt has arrived. All that remains is to keep it protected for long enough."
 mjarchitect_end.105.a: "O Architect..."

 mjarchitect_end.115.name: "Heralds of a New World"
 mjarchitect_end.115.desc: "Everything we have done has been for this moment.\n\nThe Great Host has served its purpose, and now stands as a testament to the foolishness of mere mortals, believing themselves capable of triumphing over a god. The Architect of Ruin takes the mantle as the galaxy's rightful and utter ruler, and liberator.\n\nFor our work - our endless toil - we are given the gift of eternal life and prosperity. Our minds are heavy with the influence of the Architect, yet free from all trivial matters such as pain, fear, sadness and emotion. It is but a distant memory to us.\n\nWe are on the cusp of a new world."
 mjarchitect_end.115.a: "It is... beautiful."

 mjarchitect_end.120.name: "Heralds of the End"
 mjarchitect_end.120.desc: "This day marks the beginning of the end.\n\nAs the Architect of Ruin emerged from the Great Host within the [mjarchitect_crisis_empire.GetName], its power is already having an affect on sapients all over the galaxy. This eldritch abomination will lay waste to the minds of all beings in the galaxy, forever tarnishing their cognition. There will be no more joy, nor freedom, nor life.\n\nAs the final part of the process begins - unless, by a miracle, the Architect is slain - it will be the end of all things."
 mjarchitect_end.120.a: "Was it all for nought...?"

 mjarchitect_end.125.name: "Betrayal of the Architect"
 mjarchitect_end.125.desc: "Our long and arduous research into the Veil, Great Host and the Architect has concluded. A potentially vital breakthrough led to many experiments within the Veil showing just how the Architect was unable to escape.\n\nThe Veil possesses unique properties not seen in any other reality or dimension: it is, in fact, not a dimension, nor reality.\n\nWhile rather incomprehensible to mortal minds, in simplified terms, the Veil is an elevated level of existence - much like the difference between an amoeba and [Root.GetSpeciesName]. The Veil is present in all realities at one time, yet remains completely inaccessible. The sole exception, somehow, is this Great Host, built by an unknown race many eons ago.\n\nOur scientists believe they can replicate a microcosm of sorts, using Great Host technology on a miniature scale.\n\nFuthermore, by incorporating certain processes from the Host into our ships, we may be able to take down the Architect. However, massive quantities of Cognitive Matter is required for this to work."
 mjarchitect_end.125.a: "This may be our only chance."

 mjarchitect_end.135.desc: "Everything we have done has been for this moment.\n\nThe Great Host has served its purpose, and now stands as the gateway for the Architect. If unopposed, the Architect of Ruin will take the mantle as the galaxy's despicable and utterly immortal ruler.\n\nFor our work, we will be spared and allowed to live as underlings of this eldritch horror. We've seen this Azathothian entity before, and we crumbled.\n\nBut now, this time, we stand tall. Our minds are firm and immutable. We will do what we know what must be done."
 mjarchitect_end.135.a: "O Architect. This galaxy isn't yours to conquer."
 mjarchitect_end.135.b: "We stand no chance against it. Our survival is paramount."
 mjarchitect_path_2_30_days: "Interrupting the §MArchitect§!'s §R30-day ritual§! will prevent the destruction of the entire galaxy!\n\n"
 mjarchitect_path_2b: "We will cancel our plans of usurpation, and allow the Architect to take control of all\n\n"

 mjarchitect_end.145.name: "A Daemon Banished"
 mjarchitect_end.145.desc: "By some miracle, our plans succeeded.\n\nOur naval supremacy was not enough by itself to take down the Architect. Naturally, it was almost impervious to conventional weaponry. However, using the technology built into the Great Host, we were able to weaken and distract the Architect for long enough to redirect the connection of the Great Host.\n\nIts new destination is the simulated microcosm generated by our top scientists after studying the Host and Veil for decades. Our modifications to the Great Host allowed it to work as a two-way gateway, thrusting the Architect back into the vortex.\n\nThe connection between this simulation of the Veil and the Host was cut, preventing any future individuals foolish enough to succumb to the Architect from doing as we have.\n\nIt is over. The galaxy is secured, and the Architect is contained within this miniscule machine. Perhaps it can come in use."
 mjarchitect_end.145.a: "Keep it. We will become the rightful rulers of this galaxy."
 mjarchitect_end.145.b: "Lock it up. No-one must ever find it, lest history repeats itself."
 mjarchitect_end.145.tt: "§GThe Architect of Ruin is defeated, once and for all.§!"

 mjarchitect_end.150.desc: "We... have failed. Despite all our research and all our efforts, we were too weak to stop the Architect of Ruin in its empowered state. We were fools to think we were any different from the rest of the galaxy... in the end, we are simple mortals; nothing but amoeba compared to the intellect and power of the Architect.\n\nThis day marks the beginning of the end.  This eldritch abomination will lay waste to the minds of all beings in the galaxy, forever tarnishing their cognition. There will be no more joy, nor freedom, nor life."
 mjarchitect_end.150.a: "This... cannot be..."
 mjarchitect_end.150.tt: "All empires are destroyed...\n§RThe Architect of Ruin wins the game.§!"

 mjarchitect_end.155.name: "Architect Defeated"
 mjarchitect_end.155.desc: "Perhaps by some miracle, the §Y[mjarchitect_crisis_empire.GetName]§! have successfully defeated the eldritch being known as the Architect of Ruin.\n\nInitial reports suggest that this was the true intention of the [mjarchitect_crisis_empire.GetName] when they made their deal with the Architect. As a result, they have successively contained the being to some sort of enigmatic device.\n\nSome theorise that this device will provide the [mjarchitect_crisis_empire.GetName] with tremendous power, harnessing the Architect for such purposes. However, it is undeniable that the galaxy will remain free from utter destruction, at least for the time being."
