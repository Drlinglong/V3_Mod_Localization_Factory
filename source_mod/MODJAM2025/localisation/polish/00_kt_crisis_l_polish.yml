 KT_CRISIS_CYST_WORLD_1: "Carve the Cyst"
 KT_CRISIS_CYST_WORLD_1_DESC: "With our plunge into the Killing Thought we have started to consider a new application: Carving a cyst into the shroud, inversing a piece of our world into it, and establishing a dominion of the Killing Thought inside that world. The person who performed that could then bind that world, forcing any who wishes to kill them into needing to confront them in this world, and evading any death that does not come from superior might. But first we must learn how to carve that cyst into the shroud."

 KT_CRISIS_TAKING_1: "Slice the Void"
 KT_CRISIS_TAKING_1_DESC: "Recent progress in the creation of Shroud Cysts and our advancement in the Killing Thought has allowed us to sense a force deeper in the shroud, a force that will allow us to reshape enemies we overwhelm and reshape them into a new form under our control, a sharper form, one more suited towards the one and truest goal. But first we must be able to form an incision into that area, and unlike our creation of Cyst worlds this must happen quickly, else any enemy we might attempt to sharpen would already have left."
 KT_CRISIS_TAKING_2: "Reshape your Enemies"
 KT_CRISIS_TAKING_2_DESC: "Now that we have managed to form a short term stable portal into the fount of reshaping, we need to actually control the process of sharpening. Any attempts we have tried in the lab have failed horrifically, forming misshapen and uncontrollable killing machines.

That which continues to exist, which promotes in itself the ability to continue to exist, is strong.\nAnd from this grim truth we can draw power. We will draw power from all we war on and all we exterminate until we are the one strongest thing, having proven our right to exist."
