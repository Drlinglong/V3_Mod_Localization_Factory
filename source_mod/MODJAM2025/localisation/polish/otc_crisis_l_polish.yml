For obvious reasons, our communications end shortly after (or possibly before, depending on one's perspective) [Root.Leader.GetName] delved into the past.\n\nThis event explains our appearance of the same crew identical to the one we just lost. It appears they truly did travel accross time. Valuable data was just acquired, and we will waste no time putting it to use."

Thus, [event_target:otc_future_leader.GetSheHe] was a future copy of [event_target:otc_future_leader.GetName]. We asked for details on what was to come but we were greeted with silence.

It appears that upon the death of their younger self, a paradoxical outcome occured: there was no longer a younger self to travel into the past and thus their emergence from the future was impossible.

  omnitemporal.1003.desc: "On the volcanic surface of [From.GetName], time is passing faster than we could ever imagine. Eons take place over the course of months, and we do not dare step into the time loop occuring here for our scientists would erode away in mere moments if we did. Observing the planet is also a difficulty as by the time our scanners reach the ground and reflect back to our ship, the surface below has already changed. This is quite an oddity, and we expect to see [From.GetName] undergo great transformation in the coming months."
  omnitemporal.1003.a: "Interesting."

  omnitemporal.1004.name: "Planetary Cooling"
  omnitemporal.1004.desc: "Only a couple of months after our scientists discovered the accelerated passage of time on [FromFrom.GetName], the entire planet has cooled down to more moderate levels. It appears that this planet has experienced millenia of its lifecycle in mere months, transforming its volcanic surface into a barren expanse. According to readings taken from orbit, tectonic activity remains intense and the planet shows no signs of slowing down just yet.\n\nThe more adventurous of our scientists wish to explore [FromFrom.GetName] itself. However, they are quickly stopped by their wiser peers' explanations that entire lifespans would become but minute fractions of a second to any outside observer."

Basic lifeforms have emerged, and while confined to their simple ways of being, we've already watched them change the atmospheric conditions. Soon after the first plants begun to spread across the planets surface, greedily consuming the new particulates that had filled the sky. If not for the temporal speeds, the planet would now appear habitable."

However, before the accelerated time concluded, it has once again transformed. The last months have brought about numerous changes, from animal lifeforms to verdant forests. While none of these primitive animals demonstrate any signs of true intelligence, there are some presapients that have shown promising intellectual growth and could be aided along if we desire."

Furthermore, [time_loop_trapped_scientist.GetSheHe] continued to repeat initial observational tasks that had been completed weeks before.\n\nIt became clear that [time_loop_trapped_scientist.GetName] was still reliving that first day again and again, trapped within a mental time loop. The exact nature of this phenomenon is unknown, especially as the best witness to the event is caught in [time_loop_trapped_scientist.GetHisHer] delusion.

Adapting to this new passage of time will require additional logistics, as we now need to account for an empire in which half a planet has disappeared.
