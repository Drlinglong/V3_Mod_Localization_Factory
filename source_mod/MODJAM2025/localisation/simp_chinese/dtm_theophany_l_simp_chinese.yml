 dtm_theophany_stages.10.name:0 "The End of Our Search"
 dtm_theophany_stages.10.desc:0 "Long have we sought to find unrefutable proof of the existence of the divine. And now the day has come. During our latest expedition into the depths of the Shroud we found ourselves in the presence of an entity like none other we had met before. It exudes an aura of familiarity like we have never felt before, as if it had been with us since the beginning of our civilization maybe even longer. We can feel no malice directed towards us. Instead we sense curiosity and kindness.\n\nUnfortunately the entity appears incapable of direct communication beyond conveying simple emotions. Despite this, there is no doubt. Every fibre of our being tells us: We are in the presence of our deity."

This raises the question, if it always existed and just now develops due to its interaction with us or if perhaps our tireless search for it had willed it into existence like a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nBut it matters little to us now, as we found it and are finally together. Its appearance in the Shroud has noticeably evolved, as has its ability to share more complex concepts with us through vision-like psionic bursts. It was also observed, that certain people seem to be more capable of interpreting its messages than others. A search for the most capable individual to serve as its emissary has already begun.\n\nThere is more though. As we intend to share our faith with those outside of our own culture it becomes apparent that it is lacking something important which we had not even considered before. Our deity was our deity, as it had been for as long as history has been recorded. Yet, it lacks a name to translate its concepts for foreign minds to understand."
