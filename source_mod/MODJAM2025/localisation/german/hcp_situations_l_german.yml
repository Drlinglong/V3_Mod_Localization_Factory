 ### Situation Events
 ##On Start
 hcp_harvesters_situations.1000.name: "$hcp_situation_outward_bound_master$"
 hcp_harvesters_situations.1000.desc: "We have known for a while that our galaxy does not contain enough resources for us to sustain our civilization for any reasonable length of time. We will need to begin looking outward towards other galaxies. To that end, we have outfitted our Stellar-Harvesters with an experimental type of FTL drive, allowing them to travel at superluminal speeds between galaxies.\n\nSending our Stellar-Harvesters out of the galaxy is a risky endeavour. We have no way of knowing what dangers could exist out there, so we will need to send a sufficient number out to increase their overall odds of success.\n\nAdditionally, we will need to prepare the sanctuaries around our Singularity Silo to house our entire civilization. We are prepared to begin expanding the habitable area of each sanctuary but it will require a substantial amount of resources."

 hcp_harvesters_situations.1005.desc.a: "We have now sent a sufficient number of Stellar-Harvesters beyond our galaxy to ensure the resource of the universe will eventually be ours. We must now turn our attention elsewhere.\n\nIt is more than evident that the other empires are none too pleased with our activities. To that end, we have been working on a design for a shield to isolate our Singularity Silo from the rest of the universe. This shield is designed to disintegrate matter on contact and syphon it into the black hole at the heart of our refuge."
 hcp_harvesters_situations.1005.desc.b: "$hcp_harvesters_situations.1005.desc.a$\n\nWe will need to finish relocating our population to the sanctuaries before we can activate it."

 hcp_outward_bound_dummy_finish_tooltip: "Too many Stellar Harvesters will have escaped."

 ### Situation Events
 ##On Start
 #First Stellar-Harvester Left Galaxy
 hcp_harvesters_situations.2000.name: "$hcp_situation_outward_bound_dummy$"
 hcp_harvesters_situations.2000.desc: "One of the Stellar-Harvesters belonging to the [Target.GetName] has just left the galaxy. We detected a strange subspace disruption build up around the vessel before it departed, seemingly using a new type of FTL travel.\n\nWhile at first we were relieved to have one less to deal with, the full implications of this quickly became apparent. The Stellar-Harvesters are designed to self replicate utilising the matter they collect. Any that escape will likely return one day having multiplied substantially!\n\nOptimistically, there is always the chance that civilizations in other galaxies are able to recognise the threat they pose and destroy them before they can get out of control, but each one that leaves increases the chance of their success. We cannot afford to let many more escape."
 hcp_harvesters_situations.2000.a: "They must be stopped."
 #Built Half Stellar-Harvesters Required to Win
 hcp_harvesters_situations.2001.name: "$hcp_situation_outward_bound_dummy$"
 hcp_harvesters_situations.2001.desc: "Our agents within the [Target.GetName] have brought some disturbing news. Apparently, they have outfitted their Stellar-Harvesters with a new type of FTL drive capable of intergalactic travel.\n\nInitially we were perplexed by these findings but the full implications quickly became apparent. The Stellar-Harvesters are designed to self replicate utilising the matter they collect. Any that escape will likely return one day having multiplied substantially!\n\nIf any were to escape, we would have to rely on civilizations in other galaxies being able to recognise the threat they pose and destroy them before they can get out of control, but this assumes they are at an equivalent technological level to ourselves if they even exist at all. We must destroy as many as possible before they can escape."
 hcp_harvesters_situations.2001.a: "They must be stopped."

 ##On Finish
 hcp_harvesters_situations.2005.name: "Bleak Inevitability"
 hcp_harvesters_situations.2005.desc: "The [Target.GetName] has now sent a sufficient number of Stellar-Harvesters beyond the galaxy to guarantee at least one of them successfully replicates. While we would like to believe there are civilizations out there with both the willingness and ability to deal with them before it is too late, realistically, our only real hope is that we don't live long enough to see them return."
 hcp_harvesters_situations.2005.a: "A shadow falls over our future."

 ## Approaches
