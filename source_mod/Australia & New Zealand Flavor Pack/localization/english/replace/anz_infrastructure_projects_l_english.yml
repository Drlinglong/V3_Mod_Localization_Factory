#LONG JETTY
je_anz_fremantle_jetty:0 "Fremantle Long Jetty"
je_anz_fremantle_jetty_reason:0 "Fremantle is an important maritime centre for Western Australia, serving as the region's point of access for trade and communication. However, the port settlement is blocked from the mouth of the Swan River estuary by a limestone bar, preventing passage for sea-going vessels.\n\nDue to current limitations, we cannot yet remove the bar, but we can build a long jetty in to the open ocean that barges can transport cargo to and from. The current jetty is only 15 ft wide and 750 ft long. The plan is to extend the jetty by 2,500 ft so that up to 8 large ships can be facilitated at once.\n\nEvery month#v  1#! progress is made by default."

# Jetty complaints

anz_ast_infrastructure.1.t:0 "Fremantle Jetty"
anz_ast_infrastructure.1.d:0 "Sailors frustrated with Fremantle's port amenities have made their displeasure known across their travels, harming our reputation as a place of commerce."
anz_ast_infrastructure.1.f:0 ""We entered and fought against putting the vessel alongside jetty to discharge. It is a terrible place. No place to put a vessel. No shelter whatever. All the ships have to lay and discharge at the wharf or pay lighterage... It is blowing a gale from the SW ... and takes all our time to hold her... She had done considerable damage to herself.... It is certainly the worst place I or anyone else ever saw. No place to send a ship of this size... Any man who would come or send a ship a second time is a damned ass."
anz_ast_infrastructure.1.a:0 "We need to do something!"
anz_ast_infrastructure.1.a_tt:0 "Fremantle developed almost immediately alongside Perth as a port town. However, Fremantle's access to the Swan River estuary is blocked by a limestone bar, preventing access of sea-going vessels. Instead, vessels have to dock alongside the jetty in open-sea and have to transfer cargo between different sized vessels to and from shore.\n\n#italic (You will need to make a 'decision' to upgrade the port's capabilities).#!"
