concept_anz_responsible_govt:0 "responsible government"
concept_anz_responsible_govt_desc:0 "A concept of government embodying the Westminster system principle of parliamentary accountability. In this system, for a party to remain in executive control of government, they must maintain the support of a majority of the Members of Parliament. When there is a bicameral system of an upper and lower house, the government is more responsible to the lower house as it usually has more members and are directly elected, thus strengthening the connection between the people and the government.\n\nAustralia's colonies were initially ruled by autocratic governers appointed by the Monarch. Wanting to maintain close control over nascent colonies while also not being inflexible to the local will, the first step toward responsible government was made in 1823 with the establishment of the Legislative Council in New South Wales, whose role was to advise the Governor. Over time this council and their powers would evolve."

The application and criterion of what is repugnant to English law is also often vague and influenced by political factors. While we are a non-[concept_anz_commonwealth_realm] [concept_subject] of Great Britain, we will need to cooperate with them to deal with matters of repugnancy."
