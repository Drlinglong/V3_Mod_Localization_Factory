je_anz_aac:0 "Merino Wool Industry"
je_anz_aac_reason:0 "The first sheep brought to Australia in 1788 were not well suited to the environment and primarily used for meat as they did not produce good quality wool.\n\nIn 1797, a mere 26 Merino sheep were introduced. Derived from the Royal Merino Flocks of Spain, whose wool is of world-class quality.\n\nSoon after, Captain John Macarthur, a wealthy and powerful pioneer, began breeding Merino on vast acres of land. Taking several decades for the breeding program to produce enough wool to auction, the first Australian wool was sold in London in 1821, recieving acclaim for being on par with the finest Spanish fleece.\n\nThis endeavour will be challenging, but with London impressed, we have an exciting opportunity to establish a thriving Merino wool industry at a global scale.\n$TOOLTIP_DELIMITER$\n@information!
