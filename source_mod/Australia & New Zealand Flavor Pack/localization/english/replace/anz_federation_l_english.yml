afp_federation_events.100.d:0 "Welcome to the Australia and\nNew Zealand Flavour Pack"
afp_federation_events.100.f:0 "On February 7, 1788, Captain Arthur Phillip raised the Union Jack above Sydney Cove, claiming the continent of Australia for the British Empire and changing its fate forever. By 1836, the colony has grown into a thriving community with emerging towns with wool and wheat industries. Land is abundant and blessed with many natural resources diverse landscapes from the Great Dividing Range to the Outback, tropical rainforests and rolling plains.\n\n65,000 years of continuous Indigenous culture was upended by settlers seeking to spread Western civilization. Nearly 50 years since the beginning of colonization, the settlers have pushed further inland and the frontiers of the colonial administrations are stained with Indigenous blood.\n\nSettlements at Perth, Adelaide and Hobart have been granted self-governance by the Crown, shattering the continent into four Governor-run Colonies, with other regions advocating for their own government. \n\nThe future of New South Wales will be violent and brutal. But as the largest and most populous colony, New South Wales comes into the Victorian Era with the fate of Australia in its hands."

afp_federation_events.101.f:0 "Van Diemen's Land, or Tasmania is a British colony. The land is abundant with fertile soil, diverse landscapes, and rich forests. The British established a Penal Colony in Tasmania in 1803, and the island became a destination for convicts, who were sent there to serve out their sentences.\n\nThe government of Van Diemen's Land is colonial, with a governor appointed by the British Crown. The white settlers have limited representation in governance through appointed councils, but have a significant degree of local participation in decision-making. Religion plays a prominent role in the lives of the settlers, with the Church of England being the dominant denomination.\n\nThe Indigenous peoples of Tasmania, known as the Tasmanian Aborigines, have a rich cultural heritage predating the arrival of the white settlers by 35,000 years. The relationship between the settlers and the Indigenous peoples is defined by conflict, as settlers encroach on Indigenous lands and disrupt traditional ways of life. The Black War between the Tasmanian Aborigines and British colonists ended in 1932 when most of the remaining Indigenous peoples were forced to relocate. The Black War caused the near destruction of the native peoples, although isolated acts of violence still continue."

afp_federation_events.102.d:0 "Welcome to the Australia and\nNew Zealand Flavour Pack"
afp_federation_events.102.f:0 "With abundant fertile soil, diverse landscapes, and valuable natural resources, Western Australia is a place of promise and opportunity, though not without its challenges. The British government established a penal colony here in 1829, and although the conditions are harsh and isolated, the land provides great potential for agriculture and resources.\n\nThe government of Western Australia is a colonial administration, with a governor appointed by the British Crown. Though there is a significant degree of local representation and participation in governance through appointed councils and assemblies. Religion plays a significant role in the lives of the white settlers, with the Church of England being the dominant denomination.\n\nThe Indigenous peoples of Western Australia have a rich cultural heritage predating the arrival of the white settlers by 60,000 years. Their relationship with the settlers is often fraught with conflict, as settlers encroach on Indigenous lands and disrupt traditional ways of life. Despite these challenges, Indigenous cultures and traditions remain resilient and continue to influence the development of the colony."

afp_federation_events.103.d:0 "Welcome to the Australia and\nNew Zealand Flavour Pack"
afp_federation_events.103.f:0 "The British government established the colony in 1836, marking the beginning of European settlement in the region, with a focus on establishing a free and ordered society in contrast to the penal colonies of New South Wales and Tasmania. The land is diverse and abundant, with fertile soil, natural resources, and unique landscapes that provided opportunities for agriculture and industry.\n\nThe government of South Australia is a colonial administration, with a governor appointed by the British Crown and a significant degree of local representation and participation in governance through appointed councils and assemblies. Religion plays a significant role in the lives of the white settlers, with the Church of England being the dominant denomination.\n\nThe Indigenous peoples of South Australia have a rich and diverse cultural heritage predating the arrival of white settlers by 45,000 years. The relationship between the two groups is often fraught with conflict, as settlers encroach on Indigenous lands and disrupt traditional ways of life. Despite these challenges, Indigenous cultures and traditions remain resilient and continue to influence the development of the colony."

afp_federation_events.106.d:0 "Welcome to the Australia and\nNew Zealand Flavour Pack"
afp_federation_events.106.f:0 "The signing of the Treaty of Waitangi marks a pivotal moment for New Zealand, formalizing British governance in these ancient islands. The te reo Māori version of the text, signed by hundreds of Māori chiefs, promises shared governance, but many British leaders view it as fully signing away Indigenous sovereignty to the British Crown.\n\nAs European settlers start to arrive in the new colony, lured by fertile soil, abundant resources, and promises of a new beginning, New Zealand stands at the threshold of growth and transformation. However, the emerging relationship between Pākehā and Māori is fraught with tensions, as their worldviews, customs, and aspirations clash. Struggles over land, resources, and power loom large, and the colonizers seek to assert control and establish their own systems of governance as the universal law of the land.\n\nAs New Zealand grapples with these challenges, promises of prosperity and progress for all seem distant to many. The outcomes from this delicate balance between settlers and Māori will shape the destiny of New Zealand, for better or worse."

afp_federation_events.105.t:0 "The United Tribes of New Zealand"
afp_federation_events.105.d:0 "Welcome to the Australia and\nNew Zealand Flavour Pack"
afp_federation_events.105.f:0 "When Captain James Cook arrived in New Zealand in 1769, it soon became apparent to Māori that their world which had existed in isolation for nearly fifteen generations was going to be changing very fast. Foreign whalers and missionaries brought potatoes, firearms, writing, Christianity, and more, prompting coastal Māori to swiftly adapt.\n\nAs the dominant iwi in the north, Ngāpuhi developed a closer relationship with the visiting British than did any other tribe, being the first to acquire muskets and eventually personally treating with King George. In 1808, northern chiefs began to meet in what would be called Te Whakaminenga o Ngā Hapū o Nu Tireni, recognising the need for unity to engage in effective decision-making and diplomacy with Europeans. The British Crown acknowledged this confederation as the sovereign United Tribes of New Zealand in 1835, with their acceptance of our Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand.\n\nDespite booming trade, challenges persist, including population decline from decades of intertribal musket warfare, unruly foreign sailors barely controlled by the newly-arrived British Resident James Busby, and the looming interest of powerful Londoners in acquiring Māori land for colonisation. One thing is clear: the United Tribes must remain very vigilant if they wish to safeguard their sovereignty amidst constant threats to their land and people."

Then here he raised Old England's flag, The standard of the brave; "With all her faults we love her still" "Britannia rules the wave." In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance, Australia fair.
