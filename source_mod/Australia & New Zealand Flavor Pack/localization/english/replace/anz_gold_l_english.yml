#rumors of gold
afp_gold_events.1.t:0 "Rumours of Gold"
afp_gold_events.1.d:0 "Gold has been known to exist here for some time, though only in insignificant quantities—until now. William Clarke reports an abundance of gold embedded in quartz. This could bring great wealth to the colony, but it also risks sparking hysteria among the convict-settlers, destabilizing our fragile society.\n\nThe [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_landowners',GetPlayer).GetNameWithCountryVariant] urge us to suppress these rumors to prevent their workforce from abandoning the fields in pursuit of fortune."
afp_gold_events.1.f:0 ""We are already experiencing labour shortages; enticing everyone with dreams of quick riches would surely exacerbate this issue and lead to systemic shortages in the supply chain of many essential goods and services. Not to mention, many people here are ex-convicts, how can we trust them to remain orderly and not mutiny in the face of such temptation? The gold, if it truly is here, will still be there to profit from once our colony has established a more stable foundation...""
afp_gold_events.1.a:0 "Put it away, Mr. Clarke, or we shall all have our throats cut!"
afp_gold_events.1.b:0 "Pursue these rumours."

afp_gold_events.2.d:0 "News of easy riches in [SCOPE.sState('external_gold_state').GetName] have reached our shores, siphoning our workforce and severely hurting our economy. As [SCOPE.sState('external_gold_state').GetName] gains new townships, we gain new ghost towns. Perhaps we could reverse our economic downturn if we had our own gold rush? Such encouragement may lead to unruly optimism, however."
afp_gold_events.2.f:0 "Their discovery of sizeable gold fields is attracting workers of all sorts seeking to make their fortune. This influx of capable labour in [SCOPE.sCountry('external_gold_country').GetName] is creating a booming economy and establishment of new towns based around these gold fields to service the miners."
afp_gold_events.2.a:0 "This is not the right time."
afp_gold_events.2.b:0 "Offer a reward for the discovery of gold."

#gold speculation bubble
afp_gold_events.4.t:0 "Speculation Bubble"
afp_gold_events.4.d:0 "With talk of the new gold strike in [SCOPE.sState('gold_state').GetName], speculators are buying up large tracts of land in the hopes of finding gold, leading to a bubble in land prices. We could regulate land speculation, let the market run its course, or encourage more investment in the mining industry rather than mere land speculation."
afp_gold_events.4.f:0 ""Everyone's talking about the new strike! Land speculators are buying up everything in sight, but is this a good thing? We don't want another bubble like we saw with the tulip craze in the Netherlands!""

Trials for sedition are proving difficult to prosecute with such public opinion. The battle was won, yet this is not over."
afp_gold_events.7.f:0 ""It was a revolution - small in size; but great politically; it was a strike for liberty, a struggle for a principle, a stand against injustice and oppression. It was the Barons and John over again; small beginnings, but great in political results, all  epoch-making. It is another instance of a victory won by a lost battle. It adds an honorable page to history; the people know it and are proud of it. They keep green the memory of the men who fell at the Eureka Stockade, and Peter Lalor has his monument." \n- Mark Twain"

On the other hand, the police claim they are merely trying to enforce the law upon outsiders who would exploit our resources yet refuse to pay their fair share."
afp_gold_events.8.f:0 "The license fee was introduced to handle the infrastructure and administrative costs of the gold rush, however the [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_trade_unions',GetPlayer).GetNameWithCountryVariant] claim the license fees are overly burdensome compared to the average earnings of diggers, causing many to leave the goldfields at a substantial loss. Consequently, about half of the diggers have not been paying. The police, of whom many are former convicts from [SCOPE.sState('afp_gold_tasmania').GetName], are known for their brutal methods. Because the police receive a 50% commission on all fines imposed, they often ignore due process and treat license inspection as a great sport carried out in the style of an English fox-hunt."
