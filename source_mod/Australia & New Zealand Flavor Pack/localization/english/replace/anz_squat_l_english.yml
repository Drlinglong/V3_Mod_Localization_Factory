The wealth they generate from our economic reliance upon them has entrenched the squatters as a @aristocrats! [concept_squattocracy]."
anz_squat.1.f:0 "Since time immemorial the Aboriginal peoples of Australia acted as custodians of the land; part of a cultural heritage, land was not individually owned. With the British establishing settlements, land is now distributed by Governors.\n\nIt had become commonplace for settlers to illegally take up residence on Crownland, a practice known as#b  'squatting'#!. Often wealthy men seeking greater fortune, squatters clear the land to build up agricultural infrastructure, taking up vast areas needed for grazing in low-fertility environments.\n\nDue to their economic value, squatters have now obtained cheap land leases, solidifying their power as a new aristocracy."

Squatters the utmost revenue they can possibly pay!"\n\n"The prosperity of this province is based upon the squatting interest, regulations affecting the tenure of stations is fraught with injury to the whole community."\n\n"The Australian settlers do not even get their runs delivered by government. They go forth and find for themselves runs in the distant interior, where no officer has ever set foot and would have remained unknown till this hour, but for the enterprise of those settlers who have subdued and rendered available this wilderness of Crownland.

#boost to intensive agriculture research

anz_squat.3.d1:0 "Now that convict ships no longer unload cheap and plentiful labour to our shores, settlers have been forced to innovate cultivation practices. A plethora of new inventions tailored to the Australian environment have greatly improved procceses of seedbed preparation."
anz_squat.3.d2:0 "With labour shortages and little British support, settlers have been forced to innovate cultivation practices. A plethora of new inventions tailored to the Australian environment have greatly improved procceses of seedbed preparation."
anz_squat.3.f:0 "Cultivation in the colonies had been done mostly by hand. With sparse assistance from the British government and a need to adapt to a new environment, necessity has given birth to innovation.\n\nNew heavy breaking ploughs replace the English light Rotherham plough to better clear roots prior to cultivation. Low fertility meant iron ploughs were adopted to continually break new ground.\n\nFavored for being cheap and simple, 'Mullensing' involved hitching a V-shaped log with attached spikes to a horse as a crude cultivator that concurrently burried seeds.\n\nThe 'stump-jump plough' (pictured) had parts that would rise upon an obstruction in the soil, enabling scrub and stony lands to be profitably tilled, allowing the creation of towns in areas previously untenable."

#accelerated dispossesion
anz_squat.4.t:0 "Accelerated Dispossession"
anz_squat.4.d:0 "With our land reforms there is increased engagement in the territorial growth of the colony. However, this has also inevitably meant the increased dispossesion of [SCOPE.sCulture('aboriginal_culture').GetName] peoples and violence on the frontiers. "
anz_squat.4.f:0 "Unfettered squatting needed reform in part due to extending law enforcement to such isolated areas. With the British government presently preferring to reduce the extermination of natives, border police are sent to these extending frontiers.\n\nThe border police are a paramilitary group meant to enforce land laws and control the violence, but in practice, they are often used by the [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_landowners',GetPlayer).GetNameWithCountryVariant] to murder Aboriginal peoples en masse.\n\nA cruel reminder of the zero-sum nature our prosperity has here unless we can find a way to live in mutual harmony."
anz_squat.4.a:0 "A cruel reminder indeed."

#dummies, aristocrats abuse system
anz_squat.5.t:0 "[concept_squattocrats] Exploit System"
anz_squat.5.d:0 "Our [GetLawType('law_homesteading').GetName] reform allows the selection and subdivision of Crownland leased to squatters to be put up for auction. Nevertheless, the [concept_squattocrats] have found ways to exploit the system. We could crack down on these illegal practices or leave them be."
anz_squat.5.f:0 "A committee established to review the effects of our land reforms has found homesteads only make a small portion of the applications for land selection, whereas a much greater number were from squattocrats or their agents. Moreover, with no further government support, many 'selectors' have been unable to build establishments on these lands. This has resulted in the re-selling of the land and it ending up back with the squatters.\n\nPractices known as 'Peacocking' and 'Dummies' have been revealed, in which agents acting on behalf of squattocrats erect small huts on land that they then sell for inflated prices to speculative buyers who have not actually seen it. Where a squattocrat's land does get subdivided and auctioned, elderly agents are paid to bid on the land, only to grant the land back to the squatter through their Last Will."
