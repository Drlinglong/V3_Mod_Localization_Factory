 nz_wars.101.t:0 "An Incident in the Wairau Valley!"
 nz_wars.101.d:0 "A posse of New Zealand Company officials have clashed with a group of Ngāti Toa [SCOPE.sCulture('scope_wairau_maori_culture').GetName] in the Wairau Valley, after claiming to have purchased the land there."
 nz_wars.101.f:0 "The Māori, led by [ROOT.Var('te_rauparaha_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] and [ROOT.Var('te_rangihaeata_var').GetCharacter.GetFirstName], initially removed the Company’s survey pegs and shacks in protest. The Company officials later returned with an arrest warrant. The [SCOPE.sCulture('scope_wairau_english_culture').GetName] found the Māori at a stream, and one of the anxious Englishmen accidentally fired his gun. The Māori won the ensuing firefight and executed several captives as revenge.\n \n "We told them they had no legitimacy here, yet they did not leave. We went to their camp and told them to take their things out of their shacks. They would not — but we did, and burnt the shacks, and took the [SCOPE.sCulture('scope_wairau_english_culture').GetName] to the shore and left them there. The next day we saw a warship in the harbour and the [SCOPE.sCulture('scope_wairau_english_culture').GetName] walking up to arrest us, but we refused and so they fired their guns. We are Christians but they fired at us.""
 nz_wars.101.a:0 "Unfortunate! ...But the Company had no right to be there!"
 nz_wars.101.tt1:0 "The Government conducted an official investigation soon after the incident happened. It found that the New Zealand Company was at fault for ignoring Government advice and for illegially surveying land. The battle saw Arthur Wakefield - one of the prominent players in the Company - executed in utu (a type of revenge) for killing Te Rangihaeata's wife, Te Rongo."

 nz_wars.103.t:0 "Move Our Capital?"
 nz_wars.103.d:0 "As more and more settlers are arriving in our country, there are growing calls for our capital to be moved from Kororāreka to a town further south. Those in favour of the move say that the current capital is too distantly placed from the growing population in the southern areas of the country."
 nz_wars.103.f:0 ""The surveyors have reportedly sighted a lovely area near a harbour in the golden glow of late afternoon. We have agreed that this site would be fitting for a new capital settlement.""

He is before trial, but [SCOPE.sCulture('scope_wiremu_maori_culture').GetName] are arguing whether his arrest is legal under the treaty we signed with them. They say that they never ceded sovereignty to us, and therefore the trial of a [SCOPE.sCulture('scope_wiremu_maori_culture').GetName] man should be conducted under a [SCOPE.sCulture('scope_wiremu_maori_culture').GetName] system and not a [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_wiremu_british').GetAdjective] court."

 nz_wars.105.t:0 "The Mighty Kauri Tree"
 nz_wars.105.d:0 "Our logging camps in [SCOPE.sState('kauri_state_scope').GetName] have been milling the native kauri tree so effectively that the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_kauri_nsw').GetAdjective] market has been flooded with an overabundance of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_kauri_nz').GetAdjective] timber. Consequently, [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_kauri_nsw').GetAdjectiveNoFlag] timber has lost much of its value, and many [SCOPE.sCulture('scope_kauri_australian_culture').GetName] voices are demanding that we temporarily ban the felling of kauri. However, doing so may vex local [SCOPE.sCulture('scope_kauri_maori_culture').GetName] who are profiting from felling the trees on their land."
 nz_wars.105.f:0 ""Well into the future timber may the new colony’s main source of trade, the plunder of the great forests necessary for our economic survival. Kauri logs for ships and logs and sawn timber go overseas, and most of the houses in Auckland, and thousands throughout New Zealand are being built of kauri.""

 nz_wars.106.d:0 "[SCOPE.sState('nz_anchorage_state_scope').GetName] is home to some of our fastest-growing ports, and yet, we haven’t been charging tariffs or anchorage fees on visitors.
