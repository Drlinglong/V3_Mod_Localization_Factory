new_zealand_release.1.f:0 "The provisions put in place by the treaty lay the foundations for a political and legal system on the islands. Already there are whispers in Westminster of self-governance for New Zealand."

new_zealand_release.2.d:0 "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetOverlord.GetAdjective] Government has established [SCOPE.sCountry('nz_country').GetName] as a Crown Colony."
new_zealand_release.2.f:0 "When news reached Parliament in [GetGlobalVariable('anz_nsw_state').GetState.GetCityHubName], the reaction was mixed. No one really expected for New South Wales to hold on to New Zealand, so when news reached Sydney the response was mixed, but largely nonchalant. Regardless, New South Wales must adjust to this new reality."
new_zealand_release.2.a:0 "Let's hope no one gets any ideas."
new_zealand_release.2.b:0 "Is that "Concerning Hobbits" playing?"
