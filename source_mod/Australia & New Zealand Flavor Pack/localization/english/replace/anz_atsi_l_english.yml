Although the colonial administrations are usually not directly responsible for most conflicts, and despite orders from above to protect the native populations, there is increasing conflict as settlements develop further inland. Maintaining order on the frontiers can be difficult as settlers are incentivised to pursue their interests for wealth and safety at the cost of Indigenous land and blood.\n$TOOLTIP_DELIMITER$\n@information!

concept_anz_doomed_race:0 "Doomed Race"
concept_anz_doomed_race_desc:0 "Ever since the first contact with Europeans, a rapid decline in the Indigenous Australian population has been observed, drawing speculation of extinction.\n\nInitially this decline was understood as divine providence; that their lowly status was ordained. Now with new naturalistic theories of evolution, their decline is understood within the framework of a survival of the fittest. Evolutionists regard the Aboriginal peoples as one of the most primitive of human races, suggesting their geographic seclusion stunted evolutionary advancement.\n\nConsequently, it is believed as an axiom that before the march of civilization, the Australian Aboriginal is a doomed race and in need of genetic and social assimilation in to European modes of living if they are to survive."

concept_anz_philanthropists:0 "Philanthropists"
concept_anz_philanthropists_desc:0 "The 19th century has seen an increase in philanthropists and philanthropic discource on British imperial policy with the abolition of slavery and beginning of evangelisation in India and the Australasian colonies.\n\nThese same people who have been campaigning for emancipation, proselytisation and protection abroad often sit on British domestic committes for the relief, schooling and nursing of the metropolitan poor and labouring classes. Philanthropy as a project thus views the poor and laborers at home and improving the colonised abroad as the same set of social concerns.\n\nPhilanthropy in this sense is not a private and moral relationship between the wealthy and the needy, but as a branch of imperial British administration with both public and transnational relevance."

concept_anz_revenge_killing:0 "Revenge Killing"
concept_anz_lc_revenge_killing:0 "revenge killing"
concept_anz_revenge_killing_desc:0 "When Aboriginal law has been broken, punishment sometimes involves 'payback', which may take the form of a revenge killing, akin to capital punishment. This may involve an expedition where a small party would perform an assassination or it might be an agreed upon punishment by elders to restore balance in the community after wrongdoing.\n\nTypically payback would involve non-lethal spearing to the leg, where the community would nurse the offender back to health as a means to restore social bonds. When payback amounts to revenge killing, often it is to punish the same sorts of crimes that would be punished by execution under European laws."

concept_anz_terra_nullius:0 "Terra Nullius"
concept_anz_terra_nullius_desc:0 "Latin for "nobody's land", #italic terra nullius#! is the legal principle that territory can be acquired by occupying it, under the assumption that there is no existing sovereign rule over it.\n\nIn Australia, whilst the existence of Indigenous tribes was without question, whether these tribes had sufficiently developed a civilisation capable and worthy of recognisable sovereignty was another matter.\n\nClaiming the Australian continent as #italic terra nullius#! comes with the implication that all land is automatically owned by the British Crown and as such, no Indigenous customary law may be recognised as all residents within this territory are thus British subjects, responsible to British law." 

concept_anz_frontier_control:0 "Frontier Control"
concept_anz_frontier_control_desc:0 "Represents how in control the settler population are on the colonial frontier.\n\nThe expansion of the frontier involve for us two restraining forces, which the pioneering settler suffers not.\n\nFirstly, as our borders grow, so too does the costs of extending government services and oversight.\n\nSecondly, since the First Fleet, the British Colonial Office had instructed us to make every effort to live peacefully with and respect the local Aborigines. Nevertheless, strife is invariably borne as our settlements expand and settlers view the Aboriginal populations as threats to their livelihood and prosperity that need to be cleared out, just as roots are cleared out to make way for tilled soil."
