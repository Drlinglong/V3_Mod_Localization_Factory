#Tahiti kicks out Catholic missionaries (for France)
anz_indopacific_events.1.t:0 "French Missionaries Expelled"
anz_indopacific_events.1.d:0 "News has arrived that [SCOPE.sCharacter( 'PLY_ruler').GetFullNameWithTitle] of [SCOPE.sCountry('PLY_scope').GetName] has expelled two of our missionaries. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('devout_ig').GetName] request us to help them bring Catholicism to the far-flung corners of [SCOPE.sStrategicRegion('oceania_scope').GetName]."
anz_indopacific_events.1.f:0 "In 1797 The London Missionary Society established themselves in Tahiti and since then Protestanism has taken hold.\n\nOur own Catholic missionaries arrived recently in 1834. Perhaps [SCOPE.sCharacter( 'PLY_ruler').GetFullNameWithTitleNoFormatting] has been under the influence of British missionary and diplomat, #b George Pritchard#!..."
anz_indopacific_events.1.a:0 "Now is not the time."
anz_indopacific_events.1.b:0 "We will not stand such dishonor!"

#France subjugates Tahiti result (for France)
anz_indopacific_events.2.t:0 "The Pritchard Affair"
anz_indopacific_events.2.d:0 "Our naval officer, Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars, has seized an opportunity in [SCOPE.sCountry('PLY_scope').GetName] to extract a written request from Tahitian chiefs for French protection. A base for operations in [SCOPE.sStrategicRegion('oceania_scope').GetName] could be a valuable asset, but it would antagonize [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetName]."
anz_indopacific_events.2.f:0 "Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars claims that Tahiti had not been respecting the rights of French subjects and missionaries in the region. Some say the pen is mightier than the sword, but when du Petit-Thouars imprisoned and expelled British diplomat and missionary, George Pritchard, and extracted Tahiti's request for protection, it could be said that he used both."
anz_indopacific_events.2.a:0 "Excellent job, du Petit-Thouars."
anz_indopacific_events.2.b:0 "We must denounce du Petit-Thouars's unsactioned actions."
franceinpolynesiatt:0 "Every non-[concept_decentralized_nation] country with a [concept_interest] or [concept_capital_state] in [SCOPE.sStrategicRegion('oceania_scope').GetName] gets the event#v  France in Polynesia#!"

#France subjugated Tahiti result (for interest/capital in oceania)
anz_indopacific_events.3.t:0 "France in Polynesia"
anz_indopacific_events.3.d:0 "Following disputes regarding the treatment of Catholic missionaries, [SCOPE.sCountry('fra_scope').GetName] has claimed [SCOPE.sCountry('PLY_scope').GetName] as a [concept_protectorate], granting them a base in [SCOPE.sStrategicRegion('oceania_scope').GetName]."
anz_indopacific_events.3.f:0 "French naval commander, Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars, acting on behalf of France in the defense of French Catholic missionaries, has procured letters of request from local chieftans for protection. Some say the pen is mightier than the sword, but when du Petit-Thouars subjugated the surrounding archiapelagos, it could be said that he used both."
anz_indopacific_events.3.a:0 "We must denounce this action."
anz_indopacific_events.3.b:0 "We should improve our standing with France."
anz_diplomatic_congratulations_modifier:0 "Diplomatic Gifts to France"

anz_indopacific_events.5.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('anz_samoa_proposing_power').GetName] offers to resolve our conflicting interests in [SCOPE.sState('anz_samoa_state').GetName] by partitioning the archipelago, such that we recieve the more populous islands of Upolu and Savaii to the west of 171 degrees west longitude, while they would take the smaller island of Tutuila on the eastern side of the meridian."

anz_indopacific_events.7.t: "A Counter-Proposed Partition of [SCOPE.sState('anz_samoa_state').GetName]"
anz_indopacific_events.7.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('anz_samoa_other_power').GetName] has rejected our proposal and turned it on its head, such that their proposed partition would grant the more populous western islands to them."
anz_indopacific_events.7.f: "The Samoan islands of Upolu and Savaii and the small islands of Apolima and Manono, west of longitude 171 degrees west of Greenwich, would become the possessions of [SCOPE.sCountry('anz_samoa_other_power').GetNameNoFlag], while the island of Tutuila and all other islands of the Samoan group east of the 171st meridian west would be annexed to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFlag]."
