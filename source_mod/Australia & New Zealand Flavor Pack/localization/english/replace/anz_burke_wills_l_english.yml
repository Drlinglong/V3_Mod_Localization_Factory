 burke_wills_events.14.f:0 ""Travelling only 8 km a day in our weakened state, we are in dire need of food. We could offer our precious sugar in exchange for sustenance... Or does the hunger gnawing at our bellies push us towards darker inclinations, tempted to pilfer their provisions to feed our own desperate cravings? Yet, a third path lingers in the realm of indifference, avoiding any entanglement in this unfamiliar encounter. We stand at the crossroads of opportunity and morality.""

But our frail bodies betray us, rendering our efforts feeble against their resolute defence and numerical superiority.
