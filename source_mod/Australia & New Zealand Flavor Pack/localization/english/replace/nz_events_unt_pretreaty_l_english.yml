 unt_pre_treaty.1.d:0 "The number of [SCOPE.sCulture('scope_pakeha_english').GetName] people and other Europeans coming to New Zealand has been steadily increasing for decades, and not all of them choose to respect our people, laws, and customs. At some point we will need to come to an agreement with the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_pakeha_british_govt').GetAdjective] Crown to resolve the issue of how these Pākehā are to be governed in [SCOPE.sCulture('scope_pakeha_maori').GetName] lands."
 unt_pre_treaty.1.f:0 "Since the arrival of Captain Cook in 1769, more and more Europeans have been coming to New Zealand. At first it was whalers and traders; after a few decades missionaries began to arrive with their families; eventually businessmen started appearing with the intent to buy and resell Māori land to incoming settlers. Now hundreds of Pākehā live here permanently, with many more visiting on merchant ships from Britain, France, Australia, and the United States. While relations with these foreigners have generally been very friendly—with the British Crown in particular promising to protect the United Tribes from colonisation by the French—the rising Pākehā population is leading to more disagreements and outbursts of violence, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep the rowdiest ones in line."

This would involve creating a European-style legislature led by our chiefs and appointing [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_busby_british_govt').GetAdjectiveNoFlag] delegates to enforce our authority. What he does not understand is that our whakaminenga has stood as a sovereign congress for decades, and, many believe, should not need to Westernise its presentation in order to be respected."
 unt_pre_treaty.2.f:0 "In order to regulate the interactions between British subjects and Māori, in 1833 the British government sent James Busby to the Bay of Islands to serve as the official British Resident in New Zealand. Though he is supposed to mediate disputes and hold the Pākehā here to the laws of their [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_busby_monarch').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] across the sea, he is painfully aware that at present he is nothing but a man-of-war without guns, unable to enforce any authority whatsoever."

 nz_je_unt_alliances_reason:0 "The United Tribes of New Zealand are formed of two main power blocs. The Northern Alliance, based around Kaikohe and led by Tītore at the time of He Whakaputanga's signing, is dominated by hapū such as Ngāti Tautahi, Ngāi Tāwake, Te Uri o Hua, and Ngāti Rēhia. The Southern Alliance is led by Pōmare II and consists of the subtribes of the southern Taiāmai plains such as Ngāti Hine, Ngāti Rangi, and Ngāre Hauata. The struggle between these two groups for influence predates the establishment of Te Whakaminenga o ngā Hapū o Niu Tireni, but it must come to an end if the confederation of the United Tribes is to live up to its name."
