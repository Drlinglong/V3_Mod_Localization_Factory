# 1. GB eases up on harsh sentencing. only particuarly violent convicts coming. 
#--I can't find other sources for this... really seems to be about it being costly compared to new prisons, getting shipped to australia seemed somewhat appealing & free settlers not wanting criminals around and having to compete with convict labour

# 1.2 free people complaining. add radical/turmoil to represent escaped convicts murdering people etc.
#norfolk island event? brutal treatment
#2. non-landowner/industrialist free people complain about wages being dragged down by convict labour. do something with rural folk v /landowner industrialists? option to petition governor to lobby GB 
# 3. news of molesworth committee event for GB. increase their chance to ban convicts if reformers/humanitarians in govt. If they don't, make agitator in colony. If they do, remove debt slavery, gain loyalists. 
# 4. GB/Colony program of assisted migration, gain migration attraction. increase literacy
# bounty system?

afp_convict_events.1.d:0 "We have gradually attracted free migrants seeking manual labour; they view the free labour of convicts as a threat to their livelihood with which they cannot compete. Others view convicts as a disreputable stain.\n\nThe [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_rural_folk',GetPlayer).GetNameWithCountryVariant] are petitioning [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] to appeal to the Colonial Office for the abolishment of convict transportation."
afp_convict_events.1.f:0 "Under the 1717 Transportation Act, [GetGlobalVariable('gbr_var_scope').GetCountry.GetName] transports convicts to the colonies to carry out their sentence. The practice supplies the colonies with labour and lessens the overcrowded  prisons from increasingly disaffected people in the wake of the Industrial Revolution. After lenghty travel in poor conditions, they serve sentences of 7 years, 14 years, or life, working on public projects or typically for private settlers. Some are treated as [SelectLocalization(GetPlayer.IsValid,'concept_slavery_desc_added', 'Slaves')] by their masters.

afp_convict_events.101.f:0 "Contrary to newspaper columnists bemoaning the increased taking of migrants, believing all the good ones had already left for other colonies, we are infact receiving migrants with a remarkably high level of literacy. 73% of a recent wave of male migrants were literate, significantly higher than the British average. With these migrants bringing their skills and new ideas, they will surely be a boon to our nation's intellectual development."
