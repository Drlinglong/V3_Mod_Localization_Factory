Fret not, my friend, for this guide is for you!\n\n§tSEALAND§!\nComplete "The Kings Party", then complete the focus "Construct the Maunsell Forts" while not at war. Soon you will get an event about illegal radios, ignore them. Then when Bates' radio denounces the King, ignore that too. After that, Sealand will be created and eventually Bates' supporters will overthrow the King. A new focus will also unlock, allowing for you to turn Sealand into a casino.\n\n§3Monarchist EU§!\nGet the Bavarian King, and then Restore the Austrian Relam. Once you form the United Empires of Europe while controlling Brussels, a new focus will unlock that will let you form the EU.\n\n§ORoman Empire§!\nGet the Bavarian King, and then if you form the HRE while controlling Rome, a new focus will unlock that will let you form the Roman Empire.\n\n§4German-British Democracy§!\nIn the event chain for Formalize the Kaiserreich, an option will appear to restore democracy. After that, a new focus will unlock."
