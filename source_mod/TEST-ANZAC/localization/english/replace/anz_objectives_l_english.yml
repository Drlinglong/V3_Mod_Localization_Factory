afp_tutorial_name_NSW:0 "#v $NSW$#!"
afp_tutorial_desc_NSW:0 "#lore As the first colony established by the British in 1788, New South Wales has become the most populous colony in Australia and with the most territory. Its economy is driven by wool and grain exports, with vast mineral resources waiting to be tapped in to. As governor, you will have to balance the interests of the British Crown, the colonial elite, and the growing free settler population as you engage peacefully or violently with the native Aboriginal peoples. Will you work to increase prosperity for all or cling to the status quo?#!"

afp_tutorial_name_WAS:0 "#v $WAS$#!"
afp_tutorial_desc_WAS:0 "#lore Located on the far western coast of Australia, the colony of Western Australia is the most isolated of the British colonies. Its population is small, but the colony's strategic location and vast natural resources make it an attractive prize. With plentiful land and resources, Western Australia has the potential to become a major player in the region. But with limited infrastructure and a hostile environment, it will be a challenging colony to govern. Will you be able to overcome the challenges and lead Western Australia to prosperity?#!"

afp_tutorial_name_TAS:0 "#v Van Diemen's Land#!"
afp_tutorial_desc_TAS:0 "#lore Van Diemen's Land (later named Tasmania) is a rugged island located off the southeastern coast of Australia, renowned for its stunning natural beauty and unique wildlife. After years of conflict with the indigenous Palawa people, the government has finally established control over the island. The colony is still in its infancy with potential for prosperity. However, tensions remain between the free settlers and the convicts who were sent to the island as punishment. You will need to balance the needs of the colony while also navigating the challenges of governing a society with a complex history of conflict and oppression.#!"

afp_tutorial_name_SAS:0 "#v $SAS$#!"
afp_tutorial_desc_SAS:0 "#lore Established as a planned colony in 1836, South Australia is the newest British colony in Australia. It has diverse economic potential, with a mix of agriculture, mining, and commerce. The colony is also known for its progressive policies, including its support for religious freedom and the right to vote for non-landowners. However, the colony's isolation and limited infrastructure make it a challenging place to live and work. You will have to balance the needs of the colonists as you build your nation from the very ground up towards a strong, sustainable economy.#!"

afp_tutorial_name_UNT:0 "#v $UNT$#!"
afp_tutorial_desc_UNT:0 "#lore In 1835 a group of northern Māori chiefs declared the independence of New Zealand as a sovereign state under the confederation of the United Tribes. While the British crown recognised their existence as a useful deterrent to French colonisation, for some chiefs the confederation offers an opportunity to unify Māoridom, end intertribal wars, and give Māori equal standing with other nations on the world stage. With some British officials eyeing direct rule in New Zealand, will you be able to forge alliances and steer the United Tribes towards a future where Māori mana, land and culture are protected from foreign dominance?#!"

afp_tutorial_desc_PAT:0 "#lore Established as a colony in 1840 with the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, New Zealand is a land of opportunity and tension. The relationship between the British settlers and the indigenous Māori is fraught with conflict, as land disputes and cultural differences create a volatile environment. You must navigate the delicate balance between British imperial interests, settler demands, and Māori claims of sovereignty. How will you lead the Land of the Long White Cloud?#!"

afp_tutorial_name_GBR:0 "#v $GBR$#!"
afp_tutorial_desc_GBR:0 "#lore The New Zealand Company offers the chance to turn untamed lands into thriving British settlements. Tasked with managing eager settlers and negotiating with the Māori, you’ll face challenges of land disputes, cultural tensions, and logistical hurdles. Will your efforts bring prosperity and progress, or will history remember your actions as ambition gone astray?#!"

afp_tutorial_name_FRA:0 "#v $FRA$#!"
afp_tutorial_desc_FRA:0 "#lore The Nanto-Bordelaise Company invites you to champion French colonial ambitions in the Pacific. Balancing resource management, local diplomacy, and competition with rival powers, your choices will determine the company’s fate. Will you secure France’s foothold in a growing empire or see her dreams falter under the weight of imperial ambition?#!"
