 BA_ape.0001.name:0 "Kozeki Ui's Proposal"
 BA_ape.0001.desc:0 "(After Kivotos was fully rebuilt, Kozeki Ui returned to the library to continue her restoration work. Fortunately, the Trinity Library hadn't suffered much damage during the war, and while tidying up the disordered books, she discovered something special.)\n\n§M\\"Sensei, I think you need to see this.\\"§!\n\n(One morning, she, a rare sight outside the Trinity Library, hurried all the way to Sensei's office.)"
 BA_ape.0001.a:0 "Well, look who it is. Is something the matter?"
 BA_ape.0001.a.re:0 "§M\\"Yes... please take a look at this first.\\"§!\n(Ui took out a yellowed ancient scroll.)"
 BA_ape.0001.b:0 "An ancient book? But this is an Interstellar Exploration Bureau."
 BA_ape.0001.b.re:0 "§M\\"This book should have been in the restricted section. What's written on it is related to the Halos above our heads... To be honest, even though the General Student Council previously prohibited research on Halos, as something so closely tied to us, we know nothing of their true nature...\\"§!\n...\n§M\\"Indeed... I want to initiate some research on Halos.\\"§!\n..."
 BA_ape.0001.c:0 "...I approve. Remember to proceed with utmost caution."
 BA_ape.0001.c.re:0 "(After careful consideration, I ultimately chose to approve this proposal.)\nHint: Complete the 'Repair Pyroxene Fabricator' request in the Arona interface. Kozeki Ui will join your leader list as a Scientist. Please check for her."
 BA_ape.0001.c.tip:0 "Is this a path to glory, or a key to Pandora's Box?"

 BA_ape.0002.name:0 "Kivotos News: A Breakthrough"
 BA_ape.0002.desc:0 "\\"…Recently, Kozeki Ui, an ancient book expert from Trinity, published a groundbreaking paper: 'Report on Halos and Divine Seals', and held a public defense at the Trinity Grand Cathedral. During the defense, Ui detailed and comprehensively explained the preliminary Halo theory and showcased a malleable material similar in nature to Halos: Fabricator Stone. This paper was the first to propose many questions regarding the true nature of Halo power.\\""
 BA_ape2.a:0 "What path shall we take next?"

 BA_ape.0003.name:0 "Kivotos News: Fabricator Stone"
 BA_ape.0003.desc:0 "According to the Engineering Department of Millennium Science School, during their recent collaborative research with Miss Kozeki Ui of Trinity, they discovered a synthesis route for Fabricator Stone: using Pyroxene as a raw material, it can also produce extremely high-quality luxury goods. The Federation's Research Department has now officially listed it as a key research objective..."
 BA_ape4.a:0 "Excellent."

 BA_ape.0004.name:0 "Setback"
 BA_ape.0004.desc:0 "Our research into Halos seems to have hit a bottleneck. Due to missing ancient texts or the deliberate actions of the creators, the path to further unlock Halo abilities clearly needs to be explored by us. With the lack of information, no one knows how to proceed or where this path might lead.\n\nSpeaking of which, there's still a Gematria outpost left on our homeworld. Since they were conducting research related to Halos, perhaps there are some residual research findings left in their outpost?"
 BA_ape3.a:0 "There's nothing for it but to try now."

 BA_ape.0005.title:0 "Archives"
 BA_ape.0005.desc:0 "Please select the archive you wish to view on the right."
 BA_ape.0005.a:0 "Archive No. Alpha-1"
 BA_ape.0005.a.re:0 "Title: Preliminary Determination of Halo Encoding\n\nText: Based on our recent research into samples obtained from the black market, this 'Divine Halo' is essentially something akin to a gene. However, it's not entirely the same as a gene, as its expression is also influenced by external factors such as will. If DNA is the basic unit of genes, then the basic unit of a Halo is an 'encoding'. These varied symbols and arrangements form this perfect work of art, likely a product of some Golden Age civilization.\n\nIt seems that the more powerful an individual's Halo, the more complex its encoding becomes. If we could decipher the meaning of these encodings, perhaps we could completely control Kivotos."
 BA_ape.0005.b:0 "Archive No. Alpha-2"
 BA_ape.0005.b.response:0 "Title: Regarding 'That Power'\n\nText: We have largely completed the determination of Halo encoding. The next step is to begin modifying Halos. Currently, we probably cannot freely modify Halo encoding data as if painting, but we can use a powerful force to forcibly break down some structures. Just as genes mutate under the influence of cosmic radiation, Halo encodings can undergo unpredictable changes under the influence of 'Fear'. We currently don't know if this is truly useful; these low-level individuals cannot bear the influence of 'Fear'. It appears we need to capture some high-level individuals."
 BA_ape.0005.c:0 "Experiment No. - Osiris"
 BA_ape.0005.c.response:0 "Subject: (Data Corrupted)\n\nText: We attempted to use that power to separate her Halo encoding data from within the Halo. The experiment was successful, but the Halo self-destructed after the encoding was extracted. Modifying Halo encoding was proven feasible, but the data could not be re-imported, so there was no need to proceed further. Fortunately, after losing her Halo, she only fell into a coma. Given the unique and rare nature of this experimental subject, her body is temporarily preserved in a cryo-chamber, and the Halo data is stored in a data vault, to be reused when Halos can be fabricated again someday."
 BA_ape.0005.d:0 "Experiment No. - Horus"
 BA_ape.0005.d.response:0 "Subject: Takanashi Hoshino\n\nText: We attempted to directly modify the Halo data, but the effect was not very good. Strange, Horus was clearly a very powerful individual; her Halo shouldn't have been unable to withstand 'that power'. It seems there was an issue with the experimental method. Although we lost two excellent subjects, we have already identified our next subject: Anubis. We hope the next experiment will be successful."
 BA_ape.0005.f:0 "Are there any other discoveries?"
 BA_ape.0005.f.response:0 "As stated in the archives, we found the cryo-chamber containing Senior Yumemi and the data vault with her Halo data. I have already informed Takanashi Hoshino."
 BA_ape.0005.g:0 "Close Archives"

 BA_ape.0006.name:0 "Dispute"
 BA_ape.0006.desc:0 "With the conclusion of the Gematria base investigation, we acquired some... knowledge that's hard to describe. \n\nWe transmitted the data to the members of the Halo Research Team, but it seems a dispute erupted among them – one faction represented by Millennium Science School students and another by Trinity General School students.\n\nThe Millennium students advocate for organizing and modifying the data left behind by Gematria, stating clearly that the previous esoteric theories were too uncontrollable, and the power of Halos must be completely brought under their own control.\n\nThe Trinity students, on the other hand, insist on maintaining reverence for the unknown and argue that current theories have already achieved considerable results.\n\nThe two sides are at an impasse, and research progress has slowed. Someone with sufficient Influence must make a decision. (Hint: You can consult the current Student Council President via the communications panel (though this feature is not yet implemented).)"
 BA_ape.0006.a:0 "...Regardless, the internal squabbling within the General Student Council is unavoidable."

 BA_ape.0007.name:0 "Choice"
 BA_ape.0007.desc:0 "The long-standing dispute has yielded no results. Clearly, we cannot let it continue. Before we know when our enemies will return, we don't have much time to agonize over these issues. We must make a choice, regardless of what lies ahead on this path."
 BA_ape.0007.a:0 "I need more time to think... (Decision to be made in 180 days)"
 BA_ape.0007.b:0 "Perhaps we can start with the essence of Halos."
 BA_ape.0007.b.tip:0 "Enter the §GHalo Awakening§! path, select the §Y$ap_BA_halo_awaken$§! Ascension Perk to proceed."

 BA_ape.1001.desc:0 "Since our birth, Halos have distinguished us from those outside of Kivotos, and the passage of time has made us accustomed to their existence.\nPyroxene research has uncovered the interactive nature of Halos, and the rediscovery of Halo Bombs has made us re-evaluate their significance. Since the Halo is the root of the unique physiology of Kivotos residents, can we unearth more of its potential? We must take action regarding this."
 BA_ape.1001.next:0 "Let's begin."

 BA_ape.1002.name:0 "$BA_ape.1001.name$"
 BA_ape.1002.desc:0 "We have completed our research into the direction of Halo Awakening, and hundreds of perfectly successful experiments indicate that the technology is now mature. Halo Awakening is not a major surgery; it can be done at a hospital near the dorms. The current issue is: although the trauma fully recovers in just a few hours, the process is not pleasant (in fact, it's very painful), and based on successful cases, it doesn't bring significant benefits to most people. We could offer some rewards to encourage as many students as possible to undergo this procedure."
 BA_ape.1002.Prize0:0 "No rewards, just have them stand still and it'll be done."

 BA_ape.1003.Prize1:0 "Preparations for Halo Awakening are complete; we can begin the relevant work. Many students have commented that the rewards we prepared are barely better than nothing... However, since Hot Spring Resort No. 227 no longer exists, the specially supplied delicious sticks are highly sought after."
 BA_ape.1003.Prize2:0 "Preparations for Halo Awakening are complete; we can begin the relevant work. The fireworks we used to reward those undergoing modification sparked significant discussion on MomoTalk. We took this opportunity to thoroughly educate everyone about the surgery. 'Faust can't wait,' a student on duty quietly told us."
 BA_ape.1003.Prize3:0 "Preparations for Halo Awakening are complete; we can begin the relevant work. [Root.GetRulerName] has publicly protested our infringement on their image rights, sparking some condemnatory remarks and a great deal of frenzied comments among the public. It is said that the prices of a small portion of figures that leaked early into the black market have been speculated to unbelievable figures."
 BA_ape.1003.Prize4:0 "Preparations for Halo Awakening are complete; we can begin the relevant work. Our budget cost the General Student Council quite a bit, but the distributed accessories quickly dominated various headline pages, generating considerable anticipation. Without a doubt, this work will proceed quite smoothly."
