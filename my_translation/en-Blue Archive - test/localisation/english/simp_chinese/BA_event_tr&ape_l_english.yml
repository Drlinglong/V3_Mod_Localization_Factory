 BA_ape.0001.name:0 "Koyuki Utazumi's Proposal"
 BA_ape.0001.desc:0 "(After the reconstruction of Kivotos was complete, Koyuki Utazumi returned to the archives to continue her restoration work. Fortunately, the Trinity Archives had not suffered significant damage during the war. While organizing the disordered books, she discovered something special.)\n\n§M\\"Teacher, I think you need to see this.\\"§!\n\n(One morning, she, a rare sight outside the Trinity Archives, traveled a long distance to the Teacher's office.)"
 BA_ape.0001.a:0 "A rare visitor, indeed. Is there something you need?"
 BA_ape.0001.a.re:0 "§M\\"Yes... please take a look at this first.\\"§!\n(Utazumi took out a yellowed ancient scroll.)"
 BA_ape.0001.b:0 "An ancient book? But this is an interstellar exploration affairs bureau."
 BA_ape.0001.b.re:0 "§M\\"This book should have originally been in the restricted section. What's recorded in it is related to the halos above our heads... To be honest, although the General Student Council previously ordered a ban on Research into halos, as something closely tied to us, we know absolutely nothing about their true nature...\\"§!\n...\n§M\\"Exactly... I want to initiate some Research into halos.\\"§!\n..."
 BA_ape.0001.c:0 "...I approve. Remember, you must proceed with utmost caution."
 BA_ape.0001.c.re:0 "(After much deliberation, I ultimately chose to approve this proposal.)\nHint: Complete the 'Repair Pyroxene Fabricator' request in the Arona interface. Koyuki Utazumi will join the leader list as a Scientist. Please check for her."
 BA_ape.0001.c.tip:0 "Is this a path of enlightenment, or the key to Pandora's Box?"

 BA_ape.0002.name:0 "Kivotos News: A Leap"
 BA_ape.0002.desc:0 "...Recently, Koyuki Utazumi, an ancient book expert from Trinity, published a groundbreaking paper: 'Report on Halos and Divine Seals,' and held a public defense at the Trinity Grand Cathedral. During the defense, Utazumi elaborated in detail and comprehensively on the preliminary halo theory, and demonstrated a pliable material similar in nature to halos: Manufacturite. This paper for the first time raised many questions regarding the true nature of halo Strength."
 BA_ape2.a:0 "How should we proceed from here?"

 BA_ape.0003.name:0 "Kivotos News: Manufacturite"
 BA_ape.0003.desc:0 "According to reports from Millennium Science Academy's Engineering Department, during their recent collaborative Research with Ms. Koyuki Utazumi from Trinity, they discovered a synthesis route for Manufacturite: using Pyroxene as a raw material, it can also produce extremely high-quality luxury goods. The Federation Research Department has officially designated it a key Research objective..."
 BA_ape4.a:0 "Excellent."

 BA_ape.0004.name:0 "Setback"
 BA_ape.0004.desc:0 "Our Research into halos seems to have hit a bottleneck. Due to missing ancient records or the creator's deliberate actions, it's clear that the path to further activating halo abilities requires us to explore it ourselves. With missing information, no one knows how to proceed or where this path might lead.\n\nSpeaking of which, there's still a Gematria stronghold left on our homeworld. Since they were engaged in halo-related Research, perhaps some Research findings are still left behind in their stronghold?"
 BA_ape3.a:0 "Now, we can only try."

 BA_ape.0005.title:0 "Archives"
 BA_ape.0005.desc:0 "Please select the archives you wish to view on the right."
 BA_ape.0005.a:0 "Archive No. alpha-1"
 BA_ape.0005.a.re:0 "Title: Preliminary Determination of Halo Encoding\n\nBody: Based on our recent Research on samples acquired from the black market, this 'divine halo' is essentially something akin to a gene. However, it's not entirely identical to a gene; its expression is also influenced by external factors like will. If DNA is the basic unit of a gene, then the basic unit of a halo is 'encoding.' These arrangements of diverse symbols form this perfect work of art, probably a product of some Golden Age civilization.\n\nIt seems that the more powerful an individual's halo, the more complex its encoding becomes. If we could decipher the meaning of the encoding, perhaps we could completely control Kivotos."
 BA_ape.0005.b:0 "Archive No. alpha-2"
 BA_ape.0005.b.response:0 "Title: Regarding 'That Strength'\n\nBody: We have largely completed the determination of halo encoding, and the next step is to begin modifying halos. As of now, we probably cannot arbitrarily modify halo encoding data like painting, but we can use some powerful Strength to forcibly destroy certain structures. Just as genes mutate under the influence of space radiation, halo encoding can undergo unpredictable changes under the effect of 'Fear.' We cannot yet know if this is truly effective; these low-level individuals cannot bear the influence of 'Fear.' It seems we need to start capturing some high-level individuals."
 BA_ape.0005.c:0 "Experiment No. -Osiris"
 BA_ape.0005.c.response:0 "Subject: (Data Corrupted)\n\nBody: We attempted to use that Strength to separate her halo encoding data from within the halo. The experiment was successful, but the halo self-destructed after its encoding was extracted. Modifying halo encoding was proven feasible, but the data could not be re-imported. Thus, there was no need to do so. Fortunately, after losing her halo, she only fell into a coma. Given the uniqueness and rarity of this experimental subject, her body is temporarily preserved in a stasis pod, and the halo data is temporarily stored in a data capsule, to be reused once it becomes possible to fabricate halos again."
 BA_ape.0005.d:0 "Experiment No. -Horus"
 BA_ape.0005.d.response:0 "Subject: Hoshino\n\nBody: We attempted to directly modify the halo data, but the effect was not very good. Strange, Horus is clearly a very powerful individual; her halo shouldn't be unable to withstand 'that Strength.' It seems there was an issue with the experimental method. Although we lost two excellent individuals, we have already identified the next subject: Anubis. We hope the next experiment will be successful."
 BA_ape.0005.f:0 "Are there any other discoveries?"
 BA_ape.0005.f.response:0 "As stated in the archives, the stasis pod containing Yume senpai and her halo data capsule have been found. I have already notified Hoshino."
 BA_ape.0005.g:0 "Close Archives"

 BA_ape.0006.name:0 "Dispute"
 BA_ape.0006.desc:0 "With the conclusion of the Gematria base investigation mission, we obtained some... knowledge that is difficult to describe. \n\nWe transmitted the data to the members of the Halo Research Team, but it seems a dispute has broken out among them—one faction represented by Millennium Science Academy Students and another by Trinity Students.\n\nMillennium Students advocate for organizing and modifying the data left by Gematria, clearly stating that the previous abstruse theories were too uncontrollable, and that the halo's Strength must be completely mastered.\n\nTrinity Students, on the other hand, argue that an attitude of reverence must be maintained towards unknown matters, and that current theories have already achieved considerable success.\n\nBoth sides remain in contention, and Research progress has slowed. Someone with sufficient Influence must make a decision. (Hint: You can seek the opinion of the current Student Council President via the Communications Panel (but this is not yet implemented))."
 BA_ape.0006.a:0 "...Regardless, internal bickering within the General Student Council is unavoidable."

 BA_ape.0007.name:0 "Choice"
 BA_ape.0007.desc:0 "The protracted dispute has yielded no results. Clearly, we cannot allow it to continue. Before we know when our enemies will return, we don't have much time to agonize over these issues. We must make a choice, regardless of what lies ahead on this path."
 BA_ape.0007.a:0 "I need more time to think... (Make a decision in 180 days)"
 BA_ape.0007.b:0 "Perhaps we can start from the essence of halos."
 BA_ape.0007.b.tip:0 "Enter the §GHalo Awakening§! path, select the §Y$ap_BA_halo_awaken$§! Ascension Perk to proceed."
 BA_ape.0007.c:0 "We must fully master the halo's Strength."
 BA_ape.0007.c.tip:0 "Proceed along the §BHalo Reformation§! path and select the §Y$BLANK_TEXT$§! Ascension to continue."

 BA_ape.1001.name:0 "Halo"
 BA_ape.1001.desc:0 "Since our birth, the Halo has distinguished us from those outside Kivotos. The passage of time has made us accustomed to its existence.\nResearch into the creation stone has revealed the Halo's interactivity, and the rediscovery of Halo Bombs has made us re-examine its meaning. Since it is the source of the Kivotosians' unique constitution, can we unearth more of the Halo's potential? We must act on this."
 BA_ape.1001.next:0 "Let's get started."

 BA_ape.1002.name:0 "$BA_ape.1001.name$"
 BA_ape.1002.desc:0 "We have completed our Research into the direction of Halo Awakening, with hundreds of perfectly successful experiments marking the maturity of this technology. Halo Awakening is not a major operation; it can be performed at the hospital near the dormitories. The current issue is: while recovery from trauma only takes a few hours, the process is not pleasant (in fact, it's very painful), and based on successful cases, it doesn't bring significant benefits to most individuals. We can offer some rewards to encourage as many Students as possible to undergo this procedure."
 BA_ape.1002.Prize0:0 "No rewards. Just make them comply."

However, since Hot Spring Village 227 no longer exists, the special-edition Delicious Sticks are in high demand."
 BA_ape.1003.Prize2:0 "Preparations for Halo Awakening are complete. We can now begin the relevant work. The fireworks we used to reward those who underwent the modification have sparked considerable discussion on MomoTalk. We took this opportunity to thoroughly popularize knowledge about the procedure. \"Faust can hardly wait,\" a student on duty quietly told us."
 BA_ape.1003.Prize3:0 "Preparations for Halo Awakening are complete. We can now begin the relevant work. [Root.GetRulerName] has publicly protested our infringement on their portrait rights, sparking some condemnation and a considerable amount of frenzied remarks among the public. It is said that the price of a small batch of figures that prematurely entered the black market has been driven up to incredible numbers."
 BA_ape.1003.Prize4:0 "Preparations for Halo Awakening are complete. We can now begin the relevant work. Our budget put the Federal Student Council through the wringer, but the distributed accessories quickly dominated all headline pages, generating considerable anticipation.

 BA_ape.2000.desc:0 "Teacher, the current Academy City World can no longer fully support the demands of interstellar travel, and there's severe waste of land and resources...\nOf course, various modification plans have long been proposed. Some suggest tearing everything down and rebuilding, others recommend learning from the Fallen Empires...\nAh, Teacher, you wouldn't think these suggestions are viable, would you...\nHowever, Arona's favorite is this plan: it proposes different directional outlines per district type. After the modifications, district efficiency almost doubles, but the cost barely changes! Quite incredible, right! As for drawbacks, there are some, of course... According to this plan, each area would require different modification projects..."
