 BA_ape.0001.name:0 "Koseki Yuu's Proposal"
 BA_ape.0001.desc:0 "(After Kivotos was fully rebuilt, Koseki Yuu returned to the archives to continue her restoration work. Fortunately, the Trinity Archives did not suffer significant damage during the war. While organizing the chaotic books, she discovered something special.)\n\n§M\\"Teacher, I think you need to see this.\\"§!\n\n(One morning, she, a rare sight outside the Trinity Archives, traveled a long way to the Teacher's office.)"
 BA_ape.0001.a:0 "What a rare guest. Is there something you need?"
 BA_ape.0001.a.re:0 "§M\\"Yes... please take a look at this first.\\"§!\n(Yuu takes out a yellowed ancient scroll)"
 BA_ape.0001.b:0 "An ancient book? But this is the Bureau of Interstellar Exploration."
 BA_ape.0001.b.re:0 "§M\\"This book should have been in the forbidden section. What's recorded in it is related to the halos above our heads... To be honest, although the General Student Council previously prohibited Research into halos, we, despite their close connection to us, know nothing about their true nature...\\"§!\n...\n§M\\"That's right... I want to initiate some Research on halos.\\"§!\n..."
 BA_ape.0001.c:0 "...I approve. Remember, you must proceed with utmost caution."
 BA_ape.0001.c.re:0 "(After careful consideration, I ultimately chose to approve this proposal.)\nTip: Complete the 'Repair Pyroxene Fabricator' request in the Arona interface. Koseki Yuu will join the leader list as a Scientist; please check."
 BA_ape.0001.c.tip:0 "Is this a path to glory, or a key to Pandora's Box?"

 BA_ape.0002.name:0 "Kivotos News: A Breakthrough"
 BA_ape.0002.desc:0 "“...Recently, Koseki Yuu, an ancient texts expert from Trinity, published an epoch-making paper: 'Report on Halos and Divine Seals,' and presented a public defense at the Trinity Grand Cathedral. During the defense, Yuu elaborated in detail and comprehensively on a preliminary halo theory, and demonstrated a malleable material similar in nature to halos: Fabrication Stone. This paper for the first time raised numerous questions about the essence of halo power."
 BA_ape2.a:0 "What path shall we take next?"

 BA_ape.0003.name:0 "Kivotos News: Fabrication Stone"
 BA_ape.0003.desc:0 "According to a report from the Engineering Department of Millennium Science Academy, during their recent collaborative Research with Miss Koseki Yuu of Trinity, they discovered a synthesis route for Fabrication Stone: using Pyroxene as a raw material, it can produce extremely high-quality luxury goods. The Federation Research Department has officially designated it as a key Research target..."
 BA_ape4.a:0 "Excellent."

 BA_ape.0004.name:0 "Setback"
 BA_ape.0004.desc:0 "Our Research into halos seems to have hit a bottleneck. Due to the lack of ancient records or the deliberate actions of their creators, it's clear that the path to further stimulate halo abilities requires us to explore it ourselves. With missing data, no one knows how to proceed or where this path leads.\n\nSpeaking of which, on our homeworld, there's still an outpost left behind by Numerology. Since they were engaged in halo-related Research, perhaps some Research findings are still left behind in their outpost?"
 BA_ape3.a:0 "We can only try now."

 BA_ape.0005.title:0 "Archives"
 BA_ape.0005.desc:0 "Please select the archive you wish to view on the right."
 BA_ape.0005.a:0 "Archive ID Alpha-1"
 BA_ape.0005.a.re:0 "Title: Preliminary Determination of Halo Encoding\n\nBody: Based on our recent Research of samples acquired from the black market, these 'Divine Halos' are essentially something akin to genes. However, they are not entirely identical to genes, as their expression is also influenced by external factors such as will. If DNA is the basic unit of genes, then the basic unit of halos is 'encoding.' These diverse symbols, arranged in patterns, form this perfect work of art, likely a product of some Golden Age civilization.\n\nIt seems that the more powerful an individual's halo, the more complex its encoding. If we could decipher the meaning of these encodings, perhaps we could completely control Kivotos."
 BA_ape.0005.b:0 "Archive ID Alpha-2"
 BA_ape.0005.b.response:0 "Title: Regarding 'That Power'\n\nBody: We have largely completed the determination of halo encoding, and the next step is to begin modifying halos. As of now, we probably cannot freely modify halo encoding data like painting, but we can use some powerful forces to forcibly destroy certain structures. Just as genes mutate under the influence of space radiation, halo encoding can undergo unpredictable changes under the influence of 'Fear.' We cannot yet know if this is truly effective; these low-level individuals cannot withstand the influence of 'Fear.' It seems we need to capture some high-level individuals."
 BA_ape.0005.c:0 "Experiment ID - Osiris"
 BA_ape.0005.c.response:0 "Subject: (Data Corrupted)\n\nBody: We attempted to use that power to separate her halo encoding data from within the halo. The experiment was very successful, but the halo self-destructed after its encoding was extracted. The modification of halo encoding was proven feasible, but the data could not be re-imported. Thus, there was no need to do so. Fortunately, after losing her halo, she only fell into a coma. Given the uniqueness and rarity of this test subject, her body is temporarily preserved in a stasis pod, and the halo data is temporarily stored in a data cassette, to be redeployed when it becomes possible to create halos again one day."
 BA_ape.0005.d:0 "Experiment ID - Horus"
 BA_ape.0005.d.response:0 "Subject: Takanashi Hoshino\n\nBody: We attempted to directly modify the halo data, but the effect was not very good. Strange, Horus is clearly a very powerful individual, her halo shouldn't be unable to withstand 'that power.' It seems there was an issue with the experiment method. Although we lost two excellent individuals, we have identified the next subject: Anubis. We hope the next experiment will be successful."
 BA_ape.0005.f:0 "Are there any other discoveries?"
 BA_ape.0005.f.response:0 "As stated in the archives, we found Senior Yume's stasis pod and the data cassette containing her halo data. I have already informed Takanashi Hoshino."
 BA_ape.0005.g:0 "Close Archives"

 BA_ape.0006.name:0 "Dispute"
 BA_ape.0006.desc:0 "With the conclusion of the Numerology base investigation mission, we have gained some... knowledge that is difficult to describe. \n\nWe transmitted the data to the members of the Halo Research Team, but it seems a dispute has erupted within them – one faction represented by Millennium Academy Students and another by Trinity Students.\n\nThe Millennium Students advocate for organizing and modifying the data left by Numerology, explicitly stating that the previous abstruse theories were far too uncontrollable, and that the power of halos must be fully mastered. \n\nThe Trinity Students, however, argue that one must maintain a sense of awe toward the unknown, and that the current theories have already achieved significant results. \n\nBoth sides are at loggerheads, and Research progress has slowed. Someone with sufficient Influence must make a decision. (Tip: You can consult the current Student Council President via the communications panel (but this feature is not yet implemented))"
 BA_ape.0006.a:0 "...Regardless, the internal bickering within the General Student Council is unavoidable."

 BA_ape.0007.name:0 "Choice"
 BA_ape.0007.desc:0 "The dispute for some time has yielded no results. Clearly, we cannot allow it to continue. Before we know when our enemies will return, we don't have much time to dwell on these issues. We must make a choice, regardless of what lies ahead on this path."
 BA_ape.0007.a:0 "I need more time to think... (Decide again in 180 days)"
 BA_ape.0007.b:0 "Perhaps we can start from the essence of halos."
 BA_ape.0007.b.tip:0 "Enter the §GHalo Awakening§! path, select the §Y$ap_BA_halo_awaken$§! Ascension Perk to proceed."
 BA_ape.0007.c:0 "We must fully master the power of halos."

 BA_ape.1001.name:0 "Halo"
 BA_ape.1001.desc:0 "Since our birth, the Halos have distinguished us from those outside Kivotos, and the passage of time has made us accustomed to their existence.\nThe Genesis Stone Research has discovered the Halo's interactivity, and the rediscovery of the Halo Bomb has led us to re-examine its meaning. Since it is the source of Kivotosians' unique physiology, can we unearth more of the Halo's potential? We must take action."
 BA_ape.1001.next:0 "Let's do it."

 BA_ape.1002.name:0 "$BA_ape.1001.name$"
 BA_ape.1002.desc:0 "We have completed the Research into Halo Awakening. Hundreds of perfectly successful experiments indicate that the technology is now mature. Halo Awakening is not a major operation; it can be performed at any hospital near the dorms. The current issue is: although the trauma fully recovers in just a few hours, the process is not pleasant (in fact, it's very painful), and based on successful cases, it does not bring significant benefits to most people. We can distribute some rewards to encourage as many Students as possible to undergo this procedure."
 BA_ape.1002.Prize0:0 "No rewards; just make them comply."

 BA_ape.1003.Prize1:0 "Preparations for Awakening Halos are complete; we can begin the related work. Many Students have commented that the rewards we prepared are merely better than nothing... However, since Hot Spring Resort No. 227 no longer exists, the specialty treat sticks are quite sought after."
 BA_ape.1003.Prize2:0 "Preparations for Awakening Halos are complete; we can begin the related work. The fireworks we used to reward those undergoing modification sparked considerable discussion on MomoTalk. We took this opportunity to thoroughly educate everyone on the procedure. 'Faust is already impatient,' a Student on duty quietly told us."
 BA_ape.1003.Prize3:0 "Preparations for Awakening Halos are complete; we can begin the related work. [Root.GetRulerName] has publicly protested our infringement on their portrait rights, sparking some condemnations and a considerable amount of unhinged comments among the public. It is rumored that prices for a small batch of figurines that prematurely entered the black market have been inflated to incredible figures."
 BA_ape.1003.Prize4:0 "Preparations for Awakening Halos are complete; we can begin the related work. Our budget cost the Federation Student Council dearly, but the distributed accessories quickly dominated various headlines, generating considerable anticipation. Undoubtedly, this work will proceed quite smoothly."

 BA_ape.2000.desc:0 "'Teacher, the current Academy City World can no longer fully support the demands of interstellar travel, and there's severe waste in terms of land and resources...\nOf course, various modification plans have long been proposed. Some suggest tearing down and rebuilding everything, while others suggest learning from those Fallen Empires...\nAh, Teacher, you probably don't think these suggestions are feasible, do you...\nHowever, Arona's favorite plan is this one: it proposes different developmental blueprints per district type. After modification, district efficiency almost doubles, but the cost remains largely unchanged! Quite incredible, isn't it! There are downsides, of course... According to this plan, each area will require different modification projects...'"
