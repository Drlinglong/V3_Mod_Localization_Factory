 BA_origin.0002.desc:0 "Finally, after a long and winding struggle, Kivotos has completely purged Gematria from this World. After years of war, the lively atmosphere of a youth academy has returned to this land once more—we can finally breathe a sigh of relief.\nHowever, this doesn't include Schale or the General Student Council. Although a fresh batch of new blood entered the General Student Council after the Eden Treaty was signed, it's clearly not enough to meet Kivotos's ever-expanding governance needs. Just the World reconstruction alone keeps me busy enough, and now there are matters beyond the World to handle. Even if this Sensei had the ability to charm a dozen students at once (not that I'm trying to!), I wouldn't be able to keep up!\nOn one hand, the Gematria, who have fled into deep space, pose a threat that cannot be ignored; we cannot slow down our exploration of the cosmos. On the other hand, the General Student Council President's position has been vacant for too long—Kivotos's previous Student Council President, the one who brought me to this miraculous place, I think she might never return. Though I feel a bit bad for her, I can't act as her proxy indefinitely."

I should have seen this coming, but it was too late—the three leaders from the main signatory schools of the Eden Treaty and the Head of the Gehenna Prefect Team, these four individuals, became the final candidates with an overwhelming majority of votes. If I could, I would have preferred someone without such a clear school affiliation to be Student Council President, but it seems there's no one else like that besides me.\nEvidently, there are still many conflicts within the current academic Federation, or rather, it's a Federation that's barely holding together under my Influence. I'm worried that parachuting in a Student Council President might cause the situation to further deteriorate, but it's undeniable that these four candidates absolutely possess the ability to fulfill this role.\nThe final results have been sent to the General Student Council. It's time to announce the next Student Council President..."

Apparently, she had to be dragged there by a black cat. In a way, I guess that's just her unique style?\nAfter the ceremony, Hoshino found me, seemingly with something to say."

Of course, she had no complaints and quickly took over Kivotos's daily operations.\nThat night, after I finished my own work, the Schale building was mostly dark—except for the Student Council President's office."

Her inauguration ceremony was held at the Eden Treaty's former signing location, and I could finally devote my energy to exploring deep space.\nAlthough some students within Kivotos were displeased by her past actions, for the most part, the majority of Kivotos students accepted this fact.\nSince the first Eden Treaty incident, Mika has deeply recognized her mistakes and humbly sought Nagisa's guidance on the art of governance (or perhaps the art of school management?). Under this Sensei's careful guidance, she has largely let go of her prejudices against Gehenna.\nEven so, generally speaking, she's still someone completely clueless about politics who only knows how to solve problems with violence. It's probably best to keep an eye on this kid..."

Her inauguration ceremony was held at the Eden Treaty's former signing location, and I could finally devote my energy to exploring deep space.\nAccording to her, she had precisely calculated the election results and was long prepared to take office. I'm not sure if that's true, but knowing her, I'd guess she really did calculate it.\nShe's already eager to implement the \"A Bag for Everyone\" policy across all of Kivotos, but for some unknown reason, she always forgets to bring her own tactical bag."

 BA_origin.1456.desc:0 "An alien empire has been reduced to ashes by our forceful sacrifice. Our Army has seized a large quantity of materials from their national treasury that had not yet been destroyed, and even the scrap has been meticulously salvaged. This batch of supplies has already been loaded onto Transport Ships and sent to the capital."
 BA_origin.1456.confirm:0 "Approved for storage."

 BA_origin.2002.desc:0 "Sensei, good news!… The joint agreement for the four D.U.s has now been officially signed, and each Habitat has submitted its administrative authority to the General Student Council. Now, we can begin the plan to reclaim Kivotos! When you think about it, it's been so long since we fell this far... The students must be eager, too, right?\n§RNext, we just need to send our Army to land, defeat the enemies beneath the Tower of False Sanctum, occupy our homeworld, and then we can go home!§!”"
 BA_origin.2002.next:0 "Alright, let's get ready."

 BA_origin.2003.title:0 "Unnamed Origin"
 BA_origin.2003.desc:0 "Sensei, now that we have FTL technology, it's time to start expanding outward...\nHere are the reserve funds and technology collected by the General Student Council. You can use them to build more Automated Habitats in other star systems. §YHowever, please pay close attention to our current alloy production... Habitats consume a lot of alloys for maintenance.§! Additionally, further Research projects on Habitats have begun, mainly to increase the utilization rate of existing automated districts. Sensei, you can advance these in the Ark's §HPlanetary Decisions§! Finally, one more thing to note... the formation and destruction of the Ark's superposition state is a very noticeable event, which means §Hother alien civilizations might have learned our location§! It would be best for Sensei to prepare early...”"
 BA_origin.2003.next:0 "Understood."


 BA_origin.2011.title:0 "Corruption"
 BA_origin.2011.desc:0 "Due to the corruption from the §RTower of False Sanctum§! on our homeworld, some hostile machines have appeared on the Ark. The Vigilante Corps has dealt with countless such incursions before, and while defeating the enemies is easy for them, it's still best to deal with this threat as soon as possible."
 BA_origin.2011.next:0 "Understood."
 BA_origin.2011.next.tip:0 "After this, we need to land and occupy our homeworld, which will stop the enemy from continually invading the Ark."

 BA_origin.2012.title:0 "Corruption"
 BA_origin.2012.desc:0 "Another group of enemies has appeared on our homeworld, and the Vigilante Corps has gone to engage them. While defeating the enemies is easy for them, it's still best to deal with this threat as soon as possible."


 BA_origin.2051.title:0 "Unnamed Origin"
 BA_origin.2051.desc:0 "Our attacking Army suffered a defeat in the attempt to reclaim our homeworld. But it's fine, we control space, and the enemy is like a turtle in a jar; we still have many opportunities."
 BA_origin.2051.next:0 "They won't stop us from coming home."

 BA_origin.2052.title:0 "Unnamed Origin"
 BA_origin.2052.desc:0 "Our Army has finished clearing out the enemies within the homeworld's autonomous district and deployed garrisons near the six §RTower of False Sanctum§!. However, §RKivotos§! is still shrouded in red clouds, and the environment has been deeply tainted, with these colossal towers being the source. Now there are no threatening enemies left inside the towers, and we can easily §RDismantle§! them with our current engineering equipment."
 BA_origin.2052.next:0 "Confirm"

 BA_origin.2055.title:0 "Unnamed Origin"
 BA_origin.2055.desc:0 "As the influence of the §RTower of False Sanctum§! has not yet faded, mechanical enemies are still continuously spawning. While their threat is far less than that of the §RSanctum Guardian§!, their numbers are quite substantial, requiring the deployment of §RDefense Army§! to deal with them."
 BA_origin.2055.next:0 "Confirm"

 BA_origin.2101.title:0 "Unnamed Origin"
 BA_origin.2101.desc:0 "“§RSensei§!, we've cleared one of the §RTower of False Sanctum§! in §RKivotos§! It seems that even though the guardians have been defeated, the remains of the tower are still incredibly sturdy and can continuously release corruption. There are still 5 such colossal towers left... Let's clear all these empty shells as soon as possible, §RSensei§!! This is the final step, you know!”"
 BA_origin.2101.next:0 "Confirm"

 BA_origin.2102.title:0 "Unnamed Origin"
 BA_origin.2102.desc:0 "All §RTower of False Sanctum§! have been cleared. It's only a matter of time until §RKivotos§! recovers from the erosion they caused. We've won this victory and reclaimed our home. Though there was once oppression, resistance, doubt, and strife, now we are united with a common goal. This time, our home did not turn into ruins, but was forged into our very own monument."
 BA_origin.2102.next:0 "The twisted tale has finally returned to its proper course."
 BA_origin.2102.tip:0 "Relocate the capital back to the Academy City §RWorld§!.\nThe $d_fade_Sanctum_zone$ on it has returned to its original state and can now be cleared."

 BA_origin.2111.desc:0 "“§RSensei§!, we've got results for our Automated §Rdistrict§! §RResearch§!! It turns out that when we were replicating the equipment before, we didn't account for §RPyroxene§!'s spatial distortion effect, which caused minor errors to be continuously amplified, eventually leading to a system crash. Now we have a mature solution... Arona will now inform all the §RD.U.§!s and tell them to modify the equipment!”"
 BA_origin.2111.next:0 "That's great!"
