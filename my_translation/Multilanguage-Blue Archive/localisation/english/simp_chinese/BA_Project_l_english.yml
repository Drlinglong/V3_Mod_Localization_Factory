 BA_Project_Cradle_instruction:0 "This is a project to investigate and transform our home system."
###### A
 BA_Project.0010.desc:0 "“Sensei, how much do you know about the data the General Student Council gathered from exploring this star system? According to reports, this system has a multitude of anomalies. Arona briefly looked through the reports, you see, like how our World isn't even in the habitable zone, yet the temperature is surprisingly suitable; or how the distant gas giant has four Worlds with perfect mass, orbits, and even angles relative to each other, making it completely unexplainable why they remain like this after shattering; and aside from the celestial bodies we see, there's no Asteroid Belt in the system, and as for lunars, only that weird giant World has any. It's as if someone swept it clean..."
 BA_Project.0010.a:0 "That's true, just as Arona said."
 BA_Project.0010.a.response:0 "The weirdest thing must be that shielded World in our system, right? It's on the same orbit as us, but it has a mysterious barrier. We can't scan anything beneath the barrier, and ordinary weapons can't damage it in the slightest. Arona thinks there's no way that barrier could be Physma-generated.\nBut recently, Arona found a database in the Great Tower that seems to be related to our star system. If it's okay, Sensei, please allocate some resources and personnel to decrypt the database. Arona believes it'll definitely be a huge find!”"
 BA_Project.0010.next:0 "Understood."

 BA_Project.0011.desc:0 "“That's great, Sensei! The students tried to brute-force the database with a ton of random data and actually got some scattered data, and even deciphered some readable fragments! All the classmates who participated worked really hard!”"
 BA_Project.0011.a:0 "Read Fragments"
 BA_Project.0011.a.response:0 "…verification failed, but the result is positive…\n…'s Halo was damaged, but not destroyed…\n…emotions amplified, and then…\n…attacked the relay station, intercepted…\n…descending pillar of light, removed the restrictions on…"
 BA_Project.0011.b:0 "Any thoughts, Arona?"
 BA_Project.0011.b.response:0 "“It seems to be a file similar to an archive, and it only records bad things. It mentioned 'Halo,' could it be related to the students? Arona really can't figure out how a Halo could be damaged...\n...Huh? You said it mentioned relay stations and spaceships? The attack on the relay station was intercepted by spaceships, could this relay station be in space?\n...Well, is that possibility truly real...? Could it be that there was an alien invasion of Kivotos, or perhaps an internal war between the precursors and their homeworld?\n...Ah! Arona remembers! Previous scans once detected traces of buildings on the second World in our system. Should we send a Science Ship to take a closer look there?”"
 BA_Project.0011.next:0 "Alright."

 BA_Project.0012.desc:0 "“Just as we expected, Sensei! There really is a complex of buildings on the far side of the second World! Quick, send an archaeological team to excavate it!”"
 BA_Project.0012.next:0 "That's great! Make sure to search it thoroughly."

 BA_Project.0013.desc:0 "“They actually found the database key... The students are really amazing, aren't they? So, what can we unlock? I'm excited~”\n\nAuthentication complete. Greetings, Researcher MX-7073. This is JSS, a medium-confidentiality database. Based on your clearance, you may only read all data in Sector K. To copy, please use a dedicated storage medium. Please log out upon departure."
 BA_Project.0013.a:0 "Although there are still many things I'm worried about, Arona, remember to run antivirus checks..."
 BA_Project.0013.a.response:0 "“Honestly, Sensei... Of course Arona would pay attention to something like that...\nUgh... What even *is* all this? All sorts of diagrams, flashy formulas... Ugh, Arona's already getting a headache after just a few pages...”"
 BA_Project.0013.b:0 "It looks like blueprints for some kind of device."
 BA_Project.0013.b.response:0 "“If Sensei says so... Oh, you're right! It seems to be a really, really big device! Let's leave this for the students to Research, we'll figure out its purpose quickly, and maybe we can even build one ourselves!”"
 BA_Project.0013.next:0 "Alright."

 BA_Project.0014.desc:0 "“Sensei! The Research is complete! That device's purpose is to generate an energy field. Now, listen closely, because this is huge news! I'll read it to you, so make sure to listen carefully!\n\n「The energy field can absorb normally incident energy and transmit it tangentially, thereby obtaining the energy required to sustain the field. Any absorbed energy exceeding what is consumed will be transmitted tangentially. As the transmitted amount increases, increasingly noticeable relativistic effects can be observed at the barrier's edge. Consumed energy will dissipate outwards along the curvature, with the dissipation method depending on how the energy field's infinitesimal elements obtain energy over a period of time. The electromagnetic field within the energy field is highly chaotic, but the general trend is to accelerate all charged entities inwards.」\n\nThink about it, if we connect this energy field, doesn't it look exactly like the barrier on the second World?!”"
 BA_Project.0014.a:0 "You're so smart, Arona! *pats head*"
 BA_Project.0014.a.response:0 "“Eheheh... Oh, now's not the time for head pats! We've already figured out the device's principle, so of course, we know how to remove the barrier! Should we open it up and take a look?”"
 BA_Project.0014.next:0 "Go right ahead."

 BA_Project.0015.desc:0 "“Oh! Sensei, look! Look at those ruins on that World... whether it's the boundaries of the districts or their shapes, Arona feels a really strong sense of déjà vu...\nUh, that fallen tower-shaped building, it looks so much like the General Student Council's Great Tower... That ruin of an autonomous district in the desert, could it be Abydos? And the one in the snowy area over there, could it be Red Winter?... Then, where's ETO?”"
 BA_Project.0015.a:0 "Arona, look here. Trinity General School's Ancient Cathedral is just a crater now. Looks like there's no ETO here."
 BA_Project.0015.a.response:0 "“No way!... If there's no ETO... Trinity General School, Millennium Science School... Gehenna Academy... Valkyrie... Um, where are they all then? What was Kivotos like before the Eden Treaty?”"
 BA_Project.0015.next:0 "It's probably best to let more professional people handle the first wave of work."

 BA_Project.0016.desc:0 "“Sensei, the advance team reported that this World's statistics are identical to Kivotos, making it habitable. If Sensei wishes, we can send a group of colonists to settle here.\nFurthermore, there's a possibility of rebuilding it into an academy city just like Kivotos. Arona also thinks that's very attractive... But that's not something to consider right now.\nThere will be a lot of work ahead, but Arona will be with you all the way...”"
 BA_Project.0016.next:0 "(Arona seems a bit down, why is that...?)"

###### B
 BA_Project.0018.desc:0 "“Sensei, our colony on this ruined World has been here for three years now. Over these three years, we've made good progress in developing this World. The infrastructure is well-established, and there are more and more students there. However, while our previous development utilizing the ruins was effective, the ruins are now hindering further construction.\nArona heard that many, many ruins haven't been and can't be cleared for land use, due to historical survey purposes, development hazards, and various other factors. Since the related manpower and resources on the World are now mature, we can start surveying this World, right?\nJust call Arona when you're ready! Arona believes we can uncover the secrets of this World, and that we can rebuild it into the Kivotos it's supposed to be!”"
 BA_Project.0018.next:0 "Let's do our best together, Arona!"

 BA_Project.0019.desc:0 "“Such a huge World, where should we start the archaeological work? Sensei, do you have any ideas?\nShould we start with Trinity General School's Ancient Cathedral, where the damage is most severe? Hmm... That makes sense! Trinity General School's Ancient Cathedral is where the Eden Treaty was signed, right? As for this World... the Ancient Cathedral was blown up, and the crater seems to have revealed some strange underground structures. If we investigate there, we should be able to find out why the Eden Treaty here wasn't successfully signed, right! As expected of Sensei!”"
 BA_Project.0019.a:0 "Alright then, let's begin our first archaeological expedition."
 BA_Project.0019.b:0 "I don't think we can let our guard down here. Notify the Vigilante Corps to stand by."

 BA_Project.0020.desc:0 "“Sensei, during the excavation, we don't know what mechanism was triggered, but a lot of enemies suddenly appeared in the ruins! Fortunately, the Vigilante Corps has taken control of the situation, and although enemies are still appearing continuously, their movements have been temporarily restricted.\nBut, Arona has done her homework! According to the Vigilante Corps' report, these enemies are psionic entities called 'Justina Fanatics.' Although they have the appearance of students, they're all wearing standardized combat uniforms. Bullets can pass through and damage them. The Vigilante Corps students were really startled at first! Only after engaging them did they realize they're actually quite weak, like headless chickens...”"
 BA_Project.0020.next:0 "We absolutely mustn't rush an excavation of this scale."

 BA_Project.0021.desc:0 "“It's truly astonishing that a World like this has such a history...\nAlthough we also experienced quite a few disturbances before entering the age of interstellar travel, but looking at these ruins, if we also... uh... will our fate be as tragic as theirs...?\nAnyway, the archaeology team members and Sensei have all worked very hard! Let's rest a little. Next, we'll begin the work of restoring this place to how it should be!”"
 BA_Project.0021.next:0 "You've also worked hard, Arona."

###### C
 BA_Project.0022.desc:0 "“Sensei! According to the investigators on the ruined World, they've fully grasped the layout of the original academy city on this World in all aspects. Arona thinks it's time we can start the reconstruction work!\nThe crumbling walls and broken tiles here always evoke so many emotions... We'll definitely be able to recreate its former glory. No, rather, it's our responsibility.”"
 BA_Project.0022.next:0 "Go right ahead."

 BA_Project.0023.desc:0 "“Such a massive amount of ruins... clearing them out piece by piece with old methods would probably be quite inefficient, wouldn't it? Arona believes we need to research a new method for quickly clearing such large-scale ruins. Based on the routes we have so far... there seem to be two possible directions.\nOne is to deploy space-based beam weaponry. These weapons only need a little modification to bombard the ruins, pulverizing all the debris for recycling and reuse. The advantage is fast clearing speed, and it saves resources for later reconstruction. As for the downsides... well, even if Arona doesn't say it, they're pretty obvious...\nThe other is to use a large number of specialized autonomous cleaning mechs for dismantling. While the speed is far less than the first option, and building the mechs is quite resource-intensive, it's safer and more reliable, and some historically significant ruins can be preserved.\nWhich method to use depends on Sensei's choice. Or, would Sensei like to let the students choose the plan? No matter what you decide, Arona will fully support Sensei!”"
 BA_Project.0023.order:0 "Arona is truly dependable!"
 BA_Project.0023.decentralize:0 "Then let's leave the decision entirely to the students."

 BA_Project.0024.desc:0 "“Sensei! The Physics Department reports they've completed the redesign for the space-based weapon, and it's ready for manufacturing! According to the department, the space-based facility needs to be manufactured and launched in several parts.\nFirst is the Focusing Tube. Since the ruined World colony doesn't have the necessary manufacturing conditions, it must be produced on the homeworld. It requires §Y300£energy£ Energy Credits, 300£alloys£ alloy, and 100£rare_crystals£ Rare Crystals§!.\nNext is the Shielding Casing. Manufacturing it requires §Y200£energy£ Energy Credits and 500£alloys£ alloy§!. Because this component is quite large and heavy, manufacturing it on the homeworld would incur an additional §Y1000£energy£ Energy Credits§! for transport to the ruined World colony. However, the homeworld has better industrial conditions, so manufacturing will be faster.\nFinally, there are the various core components. In total, these need §Y1000£energy£ Energy Credits, 200£alloys£ alloy, 100£volatile_motes£ Volatile Motes, and 100£exotic_gases£ Exotic Gas§!. Similar to the first two components, manufacturing them on the homeworld will be faster to complete.\nOnce everything is launched, it will take another 3 months for assembly before operations can begin. Ugh, this is truly a huge expense...”"

I imagine the students remaining on the World will have a tough time for a while.\nAccording to Arona's calculations, the operation is estimated to take 3 years, but Arona cannot rule out the possibility of early completion or delays.”"

A small portion of the mechs that have completed their mission are slated for preservation in a museum, while the rest are being prepared for dismantling and recycling. This cleanup operation was truly fruitful, yielding enough resources to rebuild most of an Academy City World, while new academy plans have been gradually drawn up over the past few years.\nWe'll soon witness the birth of another Academy City World! Let's start the reconstruction quickly! Arona can't wait!”"

After careful investigation, it was found that these tanks were highly automated, primarily designed into two categories, each showing clear traces of movement, repair, and combat. Comparing them with the Kivotos historical database, the conclusion is that they belonged to two opposing sides of a war. One side was Trinity General School and Gehenna Academy, forming the ETO United Front; the other was Millennium Science School's front. Some of these tanks had many replaced parts and showed signs of extensive refurbishment, indicating that this war might have lasted a long time.\nThese remnants clearly came from the same battle. Trinity and Gehenna jointly attacked Millennium, which fiercely resisted, perhaps because their academy headquarters was nearby. The attackers failed, and large amounts of tank wreckage from both sides were hastily pushed into the pit.\nHowever, according to the Kivotos historical database, tank battles of this scale don't align with Kivotos's long-standing military system..."
 Project_Cradle_arc_site_option_AA02:0 "Interesting, and quite suspicious."
 Project_Cradle_arc_site_desc_AA03:0 "Other members of the archaeology team discovered a unique set of ruins while exploring the World. Unlike the ubiquitous ruins found elsewhere on this World, these clearly possess a much longer history.\nThere are numerous traces of urban combat here. Analysis shows that one side was called Arius, and the other was Trinity General School; the former was a branch school of the latter, but the two sides harbored an irreconcilable generational feud. These combat traces were left when Trinity purged Arius.\nThrough careful excavation, it was revealed that these are the ruins of Arius and its autonomous region. The most intriguing discovery is a military factory beneath the cluster of ruins. Analysis of its production lines and surviving blueprints indicates that most of the rebellious faction's weapons and ammunition originated here. This military factory is still functional; for some reason, neither side destroyed it."
 Project_Cradle_arc_site_option_AA03:0 "Excellent. Let's continue our work."
 Project_Cradle_arc_site_desc_AA04:0 "The archaeological team found the ruins of Millennium Science School's main campus. After careful excavation, records detailing the beginning and end of the war were discovered.\nFollowing the signing of the Eden Treaty, the ETO, which consolidated the forces of both Trinity General School and Gehenna Academy, first cleared out Arius. However, as various internal problems arose one after another, the ETO's demand for external war grew stronger. The then-President of Millennium Science School defiantly went ahead, pressuring weaker academies to declare their stance, forming an encirclement net against the ETO. While this action drew a large amount of ETO's potential external aid towards Millennium Science School, it also gave the ETO sufficient pretext for war.\nAs the ETO officially declared war on Millennium Science School, this World was engulfed in flames. The prolonged war exhausted both sides' financial and material resources, and the destruction of this World became inevitable. In the late stages of the war, the ETO suffered a series of extremely humiliating defeats, leading to fierce internal turmoil and ultimately, its demise.\nThis record abruptly ends here. Clearly, if it were truly as it stated, this World could not have been destroyed to such an extent."
 Project_Cradle_arc_site_option_AA04:0 "Interesting..."
 Project_Cradle_arc_site_desc_AA05:0 "The archaeological team found and excavated the ruins of the Trinity General School main campus, and the information obtained was shocking. In the late stages of the war, the ETO's organization had collapsed. Although Millennium Science School intended to take over, the extensive use of tanks instead of infantry formations suggests that Kivotos was ultimately unable to form complete military organizations, and was forced to largely rely on these automated tanks, which had inferior firepower and mobility compared to formations. Eventually, Millennium Science School also exhausted its Strength in the struggle against chaos, and with the involvement of a fourth party, it ultimately led to the World's destruction. Curiously, no information about this fourth party has been found yet, but it can be confirmed that the World's barrier was unrelated to them.\nRegardless, we now know the history of this World. Witnessing the destruction of another world so similar to our own, their fate is heart-wrenching, yet our victory fills us with pride. Following the governor's suggestion, a heritage park and archives will be established on this World to commemorate these unfortunate students."

The most intriguing part was a military factory located beneath the cluster of ruins. By analyzing the production lines and surviving blueprints and other materials, the archaeological team learned that Arius had once gone to the Eden Treaty venue and done something very bad there.\nThis military factory is still operational.

 Project_Cradle_arc_site_option_AB02:0 "Excellent. Let's continue our work."
 Project_Cradle_arc_site_desc_AB03:0 "Some members of the archaeological team remaining at the Grand Cathedral ruins discovered a shocking clue: massive battles took place here between Trinity General School, Arius, and the Justina Priests. It can be speculated that the three parties engaged in dozens of rounds of repeated contention over the ancient cathedral. These battles began the moment the Eden Treaty was signed and continued until the ancient cathedral was completely reduced to ruins.\nMeanwhile, excavation members from other ruins also reported similar findings: battles between these three factions occurred in many places, with traces of combat even extending into the central ruins. If our guesses are correct, that should be the ruins of Trinity General School's main campus.\nThings are becoming clear: after the Eden Treaty was signed, massive numbers of Justina Priests poured out, and Arius also seized the opportunity to attack, sending both ETO sides scurrying in disarray. For an organization that consolidated the military might of two large academies, this was nothing short of disgraceful. The ETO, having lost its command authority, subsequently fell into internal strife.\nHowever, what's puzzling is that some clues indicate a fourth party ultimately joined in and ended the dispute with overwhelming force. And this fourth party was not the strongest of the other factions: Millennium Science School."
 Project_Cradle_arc_site_option_AB03:0 "Continue excavation."
 Project_Cradle_arc_site_desc_AB04:0 "The archaeological team found the ruins of Millennium Science School's main campus. After careful excavation, they discovered the reason why Millennium Science School did not intervene in this upheaval, and also understood the true identity of the fourth party that intervened against the ETO.\nFollowing the signing of the Eden Treaty, the ETO, which consolidated the forces of both Trinity General School and Gehenna Academy, was besieged by the Justina Priests and Arius, leading to various internal problems. The then-President of Millennium Science School defiantly went ahead, pressuring weaker academies to declare their stance, intending to isolate the ETO and seize the benefits of the Eden Treaty for herself.\nBut reality did not go as she wished. Various models of military robots manufactured internally by Millennium Science School for war suddenly launched an organized rebellion. Some of them even called themselves 'Prophets,' their appearance changing to resemble a starry sky, and they even manifested Halos just like students. Millennium Science School launched a brutal suppression against these rebellious armaments, but the number of rebellious armaments grew, and eventually, Millennium Science School students had to fight the massive robots with only their personal firearms. Although the unique physiology of Kivotos students allowed them to hold their ground in these battles, Millennium's funding chain soon broke, plunging them into an even greater crisis.\nMeanwhile, the mastermind behind the rebellion, Cross Divine Name, saw its own Strength grow unchecked. After Millennium's encirclement net could no longer be maintained, their army, led by four Prophets, went straight to the ETO autonomous zone, defeating both the ETO and Arius."

 BA_Project.8025.desc:0 "Our excavation efforts on the ruined Kivotos World weren't exactly kept completely under wraps. A project of this scale couldn't possibly escape the investigations of other curious students. Through various means, they've uncovered what truly happened to this World, which shares our very origins: the war and destruction caused by 'us'... At the same time, revelations about the ruined World have started to appear on online forums, and the students' reactions are huge. Even if not everyone knows everything yet, if we don't react, soon nothing will remain hidden. Is this retribution for the crimes 'we' committed? Should we erase the information spreading online? Or perhaps all students should know the truth? We must make a choice, even if it might make other students dislike us."

Looking at this situation, we must prepare for unexpected enemies that could appear at any time in the future."
