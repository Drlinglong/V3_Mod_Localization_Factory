#### 蓝鲸之梦（星野就职事件链）
 BA_origin.0101.name:0 "Walking the Crossroads of Past and Future"
 BA_origin.0101.desc:0 "Hoshino said nothing, merely motioning for me to follow her. As I walked behind her, I found myself slowly admiring this girl, a head shorter than me. \n On the surface, she seemed no different from any other girl. If I had to describe her impression, perhaps \"listless\"? As if she's seen everything life has to offer.\n But if you observe closely, you'll notice a temperament unlike ordinary people: every step she takes is always firm, like someone who has emerged from life's trials, someone who, once she sets her mind on a goal, never looks back. The shotgun on her back is always meticulously maintained; even for someone as lazy as her, there must be things she cannot neglect, right? And indeed it is so. Abydos, from its initial two students, to just her remaining, to its current prosperity – all the hardships and storms endured during this time coalesced into this person, the one who would revive Abydos. I believe she is ready to face any challenge.\n Walking through the now bustling Abydos, I couldn't help but feel she was out of place with her surroundings. I noticed her unusual attire, an old, worn bulletproof vest. I seemed to have seen it somewhere before… in old photographs…\n I think I understood some things. Perhaps, in her eyes, this current prosperity means nothing, does it?"
 BA_origin.0101.a:0 "Because, at her celebration, there was someone missing."
 BA_origin.0101.b:0 "And that person, perhaps, would never come back."

 BA_origin.0102.name:0 "A Future We Face Together"
 BA_origin.0102.desc:0 "The two of us avoided the bustling, ceaseless traffic and made our way to a place I felt nostalgic for—Abydos's old school building. This area was as quiet as ever, perhaps intentionally so by her.\n We didn't speak the whole way. She led me to what used to be the Foreclosure Task Force clubroom. Though it hadn't been used for a long time, there was no sense of decay at all. We sat in our usual spots, and I noticed there was an extra chair in the clubroom than usual.\n \"So, Hoshino, why did you suddenly want to come back and see this place?\"\n \"Just suddenly felt nostalgic for the old days…\" She looked out the window, which faced the last stretch of Abydos's desert—I remembered it as the place where the Desert Festival used to be held.\n \"This old man, I used to not believe in miracles in this world. I always thought they were just things you'd tell kids… But when I face the sight of such prosperity now, I have to admit—it truly is a living miracle.\"\n \"A miracle that Sensei and I witnessed together…\" \n I wasn't sure how to answer those meaningful words, but one thing was clear…"
 BA_origin.0102.a:0 "I decided to give my utmost to support this strong girl."

 BA_origin.0103.name:0 "Before Dawn"
 BA_origin.0103.desc:0 "Hoshino woke up exceptionally early today, perhaps because she found it hard to sleep last night. Normally, Hoshino would definitely go back to sleep for a bit, but today she just couldn't fall back asleep.\n She didn't wear her student council president's uniform, but instead, for the first time in a while, changed into the Abydos school uniform she had always treasured. Still feeling uneasy, she simply put on that bulletproof vest too.\n Sometime unknowingly, the weather near Schale turned cloudy, wet and cold. Thick, cotton-like fog drifted over the streets. Through this pervasive mist, even the neon lights appeared as large, indistinct blurs. A thin layer of water droplets clung to Hoshino's face, viscous like a spiderweb.\n She suddenly began to miss Abydos's dry climate; at least there wouldn't be such annoying fog, and… Abydos's senior…\n The sky gradually lightened. Hoshino shed her usual listlessness and jaded outlook on life—only she knew it was merely a poor imitation of her senior. In its place was a stoic expression, which was her true self. At least, she believed she had never changed.\n The stars and moon had receded, but the sun had yet to rise. This gloomy sky was so empty and lonely."
 BA_origin.0103.a:0 "The time just before sunrise is often the darkest."

 BA_origin.0104.name:0 "Dream of the Whale"
 BA_origin.0104.desc:0 "In her leisure time, Hoshino would always return to the resort, silently gazing at the sea. The calm sea, rising and falling mechanically—what was it that so attracted this girl from the heart of the desert?\n She gazed at the calm sea, imagining a world beneath its surface where everyone was together. She had never truly seen the underwater world, and precisely because she hadn't seen it, it could hold her hopes.\n She gazed at the calm sea. She knew this was merely her fantasy; at least whales didn't exist beneath the oceans of Kivotos. Yet, even if she couldn't meet a whale, wouldn't the fish in the sea still live on strongly and happily?\n She gazed at the calm sea. Why did she suddenly feel sad? She had personally buried her senior, and with her, her own past. She should have promised the whale to bid farewell to tears from then on. She shed the maturity she had feigned, because true maturity is never something you put on display.\n She gazed at the calm sea. Why did she suddenly recall the past? Perhaps the whale would never return, but she still waited there for a long, long time. She wanted to slowly recount Abydos's path to revival, and the true maturity she had gained after enduring countless hardships.\n Having walked through nights without starlight, having washed away the dust of the past, as she now welcomed the newly risen sun, she was no longer alone. Behind her were the juniors who had accompanied her this far, and an adult she could absolutely trust."
 BA_origin.0104.a:0 "This girl, who calls herself an old man, decided to chase her past dream once more."

 BA_origin.0105.name:0 "At the Starting Point of a Miracle"
 BA_origin.0105.desc:0 "You're here about Senior Yume, aren't you?\" The moment Hoshino-chan walked in, I could tell something from her face, especially regarding Senior Yume.\n \"Nothing gets past Sensei, huh…\" She gave an awkward laugh. \"This old man will be direct. Since the Halo research is still being debated, it'd be better for Sensei to approve the related research.\"\n \"That's no problem. I'll inform Millennium's side shortly. After all, Yume is also a student of Kivotos. Hoshino-chan, just go for it! It's rare to see this lazy old man so motivated~\"\n \"Sensei is making fun of this old man again! (Quietly) I'm working hard too, you know…\"\n \"Yes, Hoshino-chan is working hard.\"\n For some reason, as she walked out of Schale, she suddenly felt an unusual sense of lightness."
 BA_origin.0105.a:0 "Perhaps, without her noticing, she was slowly changing too."

 BA_origin.0106.name:0 "Dream of the Whale – Halo Analysis"
 BA_origin.0106.desc:0 "Hoshino-chan stepped down from the experimental apparatus. The analysis of her Halo's main components was complete. This data would be used to create a blank Halo for Senior Yume and to prepare for creating Halos for other beings in the future.\n After all, this apparatus was once a technological product of Gematria. Although it had been decontaminated, we still opposed Hoshino, who was a former victim, participating in this experiment.\n However, Hoshino herself didn't care about that. She said there was no one more suitable for this experiment than her, a former test subject. Perhaps she just wanted to contribute her own strength to her senior's awakening."
 BA_origin.0106.a:0 "Let's proceed with the next step."

 BA_origin.0107.name:0 "Dream of the Whale – Blank Halo Creation"
 BA_origin.0107.desc:0 "Based on the analysis results, we need materials capable of holding Halo energy to create a Halo. Pyroxene is a cheap option, but its holding capacity is far from enough. Therefore, we temporarily have to use rare Divine Script. Perhaps we'll find better alternatives in the future.\n A blank, brand new Halo has been created. It looks just like the Halos on the mob-chans commonly seen throughout Kivotos, perhaps even more primitive. We will import Senior Yume's Halo data through a pre-reserved interface. This data is unique; success or failure depends on this single attempt."
 BA_origin.0107.a:0 "Go for it."

 BA_origin.0108.name:0 "Dream of the Whale – Return"
 BA_origin.0108.desc:0 "The transmission link established by Pyroxene was incredibly slow. As the last bit of data was injected, the Halo's shape changed accordingly. After confirming the Halo's stable state, we carefully connected it to Yume's body.\n After the Halo activation sequence, she slowly opened her eyes.\n \"Hmm… where is this? I thought I was in the laboratory…\"\n \"It seems your memory is fine… Ah, how rude of me. I should introduce myself first. I am Sensei, from the Schale Galactic Exploration Bureau. You probably don't know me. I know you must have many questions right now, but there's something more important—Hoshino-chan is waiting for you outside. Go see her when you're ready.\"\n I paused.\n \"She's been waiting for you, waiting for a very long time. Probably for several years now.\"\n …\n The moment their gazes met, both their expressions and actions froze. It was as if even the air seemed to condense. After years apart, so many words they wanted to say, the changes in Abydos, Schale's Sensei, the world in the starry sky… all of it was stuck in their throats at that moment, not knowing where to start. After a long silence, Hoshino-chan was the first to break the awkward situation:"
 BA_origin.0108.a:0 "Long time no see, Senior."
 BA_origin.0108.b:0 "Welcome back, Senior."

 BA_origin.0109.name:0 "Epilogue"
 BA_origin.0109.desc:0 "About a month later, a new visitor arrived at the Schale building.\n \"Oh, an unexpected guest. How have things been with Hoshino-chan this past month? She hasn't been clinging to you too much, has she?\"\n \"Actually, it's been fine. I can't believe how much Abydos has changed. I came today to thank Sensei.\"\n \"Oh, you don't need to thank me. Honestly, it was all Hoshino-chan's own effort. She and her juniors worked hard to pay off their debts, and then she contacted Millennium's engineering department… I just helped her make the connections.\"\n \"Hoshino-chan herself has changed a lot too! After all, with her old personality, she probably wouldn't have sought out collaborations with others. By the way, though she might not realize it herself, she seems particularly attentive to Sensei's affairs~\"\n Saying this, she mysteriously handed me a card.\n \"(Whispering) Well then, let me, as her senior, give her a little push.\" \"So, Sensei, don't disappoint Hoshino-chan, okay?\"\n Before I could react, she had already left Schale. The card she left behind boldly read \"Ocean-themed custom wedding rings."
 BA_origin.0109.a:0 "What in the world is this?"

 BA_origin.0401.name:0 "The Bagless Girl"
 BA_origin.0401.desc:0 "This matter caused Hayase Yuuka great dissatisfaction. After finishing the General Student Council's financial work, she immediately submitted an application to the Engineering Department.\n The Engineering Department's top minds tried many methods, including high-tech solutions and the simplest, most brutal method—tying Yuuka and her tactical bag together. But Yuuka always managed to lose her bag in all sorts of bizarre ways.\n After a long struggle, Yuuka finally gave up her desire for a tactical bag—for now. According to her precise calculations (I have no idea what she was calculating), she believed that one day she'd be able to get a tactical bag."
 BA_origin.0401.a:0 "I hope her wish comes true."

 BA_origin.0201.name:0 "Committee Head Hina is Still Busy"
 BA_origin.0201.desc:0 "On my way to the office, I suddenly remembered what Amau Ako had told me, so I casually brewed a cup of coffee.\n Hina was still buried in her work and didn't notice my arrival. I placed the coffee next to her, and out of muscle memory, she picked it up and took a sip.\n \"Ako… didn't I tell you not to make the coffee so sweet?\" She looked up with a hint of displeasure, only then realizing she'd mistaken me for someone else.\n \"My apologies, President Hina. Do you prefer it a bit bitter? Oh, right, I'll tell Ako that President Hina misses her very much. I think she'll be very happy.\"\n \"Sensei… please don't make fun of me.\" Saying this, she returned her attention to her work. Hina was as diligent as ever. But then again, this work could also be done tomorrow."
 BA_origin.0201.a:0 "After all, there's still a long road ahead."

We once again received white stocking photos of [From.GetName], the photos vanishing at FTL speed just like last time, and once again leaving the same mysterious message:\n“§YPeek§!” What's different from last time is that we managed to capture the sender's ID, and from the fleeting glimpse of the photo, we discovered that it wasn't actually [From.GetName], but the sender themselves."

 BA_Easter_egg.0011.title:0 "Mining Incident"
 BA_Easter_egg.0011.desc:0 "Recently, a rather fervent mining craze has swept through Kivotos.\nFor months, countless chips have been assembled into GPUs, sent like clockwork to dedicated mining facilities to extract a certain encrypted digital currency.\nWhile the currency's algorithm is quite sophisticated, and its security and reliability are well-guaranteed, currency trading is, after all, an outdated economic method from the pre-FTL era. Furthermore, the mining process consumes a vast amount of energy for no good reason, and components that have undergone high-load operation pose risks when used for other purposes.\nIn any case, it's time to put an end to this farce. Following strong protests from the Mediation Department, the General Student Council has already put the prohibition plan on its agenda."
 BA_Easter_egg.0011.a:0 "Someone must be pulling the strings behind all of this."
 BA_Easter_egg.0011.a.tip:0 "They should have dealt with this sooner."
 BA_Easter_egg.0011.b:0 "This kind of speculative craze comes quickly and goes quickly, just calm down."
 BA_Easter_egg.0011.b.tip:0 "It's just a prank, really, let's just forget about it."

 BA_Easter_egg.0012.title:0 "Mining Incident"
 BA_Easter_egg.0012.desc:0 "The Mediation Department first dispatched some informants to several underground mining facilities, starting with the currently popular cryptocurrencies, and gradually analyzing the money flow, algorithms, and players behind them. As the investigation delved deeper, a company name slowly surfaced, revealing its significant involvement: §ENephthys§!."
 BA_Easter_egg.0012.a:0 "...Let's talk to the people involved first."

 BA_Easter_egg.0013.title:0 "Mining Incident"
 BA_Easter_egg.0013.desc:0 "The Mediation Department organized a secret discussion between the General Student Council and the representatives of Nephthys. The outcome was quite astounding: Nephthys had used various methods to consolidate the current digital currency network's computing power resources, acquiring a considerable amount of hardware meant for mining, and repurposed these devices for AI. According to Nephthys's Representative, §YIzayoi Nonomi§!, the purpose of this was to eliminate the 'resurfacing currency economy'. After confirming that both parties' objectives aligned, Nonomi, representing Nephthys, stated that they would continue to deal with these improperly used hardware components and currently required some assistance from the General Student Council; in exchange, Nephthys could provide a name to the General Student Council."
 BA_Easter_egg.0013.a:0 "A name..."

 BA_Easter_egg.0014.title:0 "Behind the Mining Incident"
 BA_Easter_egg.0014.desc:0 "Based on the clues provided by Nonomi, the Mediation Department easily apprehended this person. This individual's name is §YTouru Shiroishi§!, and though relatively unknown, they are currently responsible for designing most of the currency algorithms and have obtained considerable income by selling plans and receiving dividends. Even more astonishing is that this income was primarily used to purchase and hoard daily necessities. By the time of their capture, the accumulated supplies they had ordered were enough for tens of thousands of people for an entire year."
 BA_Easter_egg.0014.a:0 "Although I don't quite understand what you were doing, it's time for this farce to conclude."

 BA_Easter_egg.0015.title:0 "Behind the Mining Incident"
