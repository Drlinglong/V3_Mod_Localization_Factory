In fact, not long after the Outer Rim Comms Link was activated, we gained more and more information from the Outer Rim, which significantly helped us repair the Comms Link Interface located within our territory. However, we had not taken any actual repair action because we had unanimously decided not to interfere too much with the outside world. But now circumstances are different. For the reason we have held steadfast to until now, we must act today. Fortunately, our first repair attempt was a huge success, and the Comms Link Interface within KETHER is now operational.§R Final warning: While other Comms Link Interfaces are for public use, unauthorized use of the Gateway within KETHER is not permitted. Please be aware.§!"

 BA_Precursor.0051.title:0 "Comms Link Interface Discovered"
 BA_Precursor.0051.desc:0 "Upon entering this Black Hole system, [from.GetName] immediately noticed something unusual about it: a Gateway-like structure was quietly operating at the edge of the system. Just like the silent Black Hole at the system's center, anything that enters this Gateway, be it matter or probe signals, never returns. The crew has put forward various hypotheses regarding the Gateway's purpose, but none can currently be empirically verified."

 BA_Precursor.0057.title:0 "Clue"
 BA_Precursor.0057.desc:0 "We've detected some extremely dangerous anomalous signals and material traces on a World in the Communication Link Interface System. Analysis suggests these are remnants of a ground war fought by the Precursor Empire that built this Gateway, likely over control of the Gateway itself. If we want to learn more, we'll need to take action."

 BA_Precursor.0102.desc:0 "“Hello, remaining Kivotos outsiders. We are Moe Xcom. As you can see, the comm links in this system were built by our enemies. After finding our answers, we couldn't gain outward access to the comm links, so we've only been able to infer the situation outside the star cluster through scattered bits of leaked information. However... after such a long period of peace, and even though we've cracked the external comm links, our technological level is now far superior to yours. We've collectively decided that we shouldn't interfere with the dynamics of the external star systems. Therefore, we've chosen not to continue our internal Gateway repair Research to avoid creating consequences even we can't reverse.”"

The one-way transport Cost for these ships will be 1000 Energy Credits, to be borne by you. The outbound Cost must be paid by you. For the return trip, we offer you two options: paying the return Cost to send the ship back, or, at the Cost of some stored transport capacity, keeping the ship. Afterward, we won't interfere if you wish to dismantle or reverse-Research it.\nAdditionally, we are quite in need of various information from the Outer Worlds. If you are willing to provide it, we will offer you abundant rewards you absolutely cannot refuse... We definitely won't shortchange you! So, what do you say? It's a deal you absolutely can't refuse, right?!"
