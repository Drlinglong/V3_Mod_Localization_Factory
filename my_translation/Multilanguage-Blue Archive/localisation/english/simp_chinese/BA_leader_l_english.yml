 BA_communication.Hoshino.desc:"Sensei! Your old man is here to help you out~ You don't have to carry all the burdens yourself, you know~ Relaxing is important too. What? Sensei wants your old man to lead a fleet to defend the borders? Ugh~ What a pain, but I guess I can't help it."
 BA_communication.Hoshino.a:"Hoshino, are you trying to slack off?"
 BA_communication.Hoshino.a.response:"Hehe~ It's all about balancing work and rest, you know. Your old man needs his downtime too."
 BA_communication.Hoshino.b:"Is there anything Hoshino is concerned about before taking the position?"
 BA_communication.Hoshino.b.response:"Nope, Sensei! If anything, helping Sensei with tasks sounds pretty good~"
 BA_communication.Hoshino.c:"All in all, thank you for coming to help, Hoshino."

 BA_communication.Yuuka.title:"Recruit Candidate: §B$NAME_Yuuka$§!"
 BA_communication.Yuuka.desc:"Sensei! Welcome back! Just as I calculated, you arrived precisely on time. How have you been lately? Have you been eating properly? Resting well? Sensei, you haven't been spending money carelessly, have you? Have you been taking good care of yourself during the time I wasn't with you?"
 BA_communication.Yuuka.a:"Ahaha... Schale's scope of management has been expanding lately, so, you know..."
 BA_communication.Yuuka.a.response:"Just look at you! You must have been overexerting yourself again these past few days! Sigh, look at those obvious dark circles under your eyes, that unkempt stubble... You always say adults should solve their own problems, but you could have just called me for help! It's clear Sensei can't manage without me, after all..."
 BA_communication.Yuuka.b:"Hehe, I get your feelings, Yuuka. As expected, my little Yuuka cares about me the most."
 BA_communication.Yuuka.b.response:"N-no, it's not like I particularly care or anything! You're everyone's Sensei, after all, and if you were to fall ill, the entire Kivotos would fall into chaos... S-so, Sensei, please make sure to ask for my help with anything! Even if it's for the sake of all Kivotos, I'll definitely give it my all!\n     Actually, I just want to spend more time with Sensei, too (whispering)..."
 BA_communication.Yuuka.c:"If that's the case, then I won't hold back, okay? Kivotos currently needs some administrators to serve as governors. Can I leave that to you, Yuuka?"
 BA_communication.Yuuka.c.response:"Hmph~ Hmph~ Hmph~ Well, you've come to the right person! When it comes to administrative management, I'm confident I'm second to none! Whether it's financial summaries, fund allocation, or Decision reviews, these are all things I excel at in Seminar. Even though I'll be responsible for a World much larger than a single academy now... I'll still give it my all! You can even leave the financial expenditures for all of Kivotos, and even for yourself, to me; I'm perfectly fine with it!"
 BA_communication.Yuuka.d:"In that case, I'll trust in your abilities, Yuuka. You always tell me not to overexert myself, but it's the same for my little Yuuka; make sure to get some rest."
 BA_communication.Yuuka.d.response:"Hmph, even though Sensei, you're clearly the one who cares least about your own health... But if you insist on doing this, then let's make this an agreement between the two of us-work hard when it's time to work, and rest well when it's time to rest! Together, let's factorize away all the sadness and anger!"
