This constant state of readiness is why SRT is renowned as SRT.§H\n...Unlike Valkyrie Academy.§!\nEven the Public Safety Bureau, said to value rules the most, wears casual clothes and does whatever they want after school, right?

SRT has a 'Justice' that belongs only to SRT. If I were to explain, it's not a difficult concept. But you're not unfamiliar with Justice either, are you?\nI've heard that other schools also have groups similar to ours... Even in Valkyrie, students believe their every action is an act of 'Justice.' But for me, none of that is true Justice.\n§H'Justice' is derived from truth; it should not change depending on the opponent or the situation. However, the various security organizations in Valkyrie are in a situation where they must weigh various interests. 'Justice' is thus constantly distorted by their individual views and ideas.§!\nOnly SRT... can remain unaffected and uphold its own Justice, pursuing the one true Justice regardless of time, place, or opponent..."

Exhibition staff stated that the stolen golden salmon is unlikely to be recovered, but its taste is not significantly different from regular salmon...\nThe stolen vehicle, a recently purchased transport for cafeteria ingredients, unfortunately plunged into a river and was totaled due to combined efforts of security forces' interception fire and the driver's own driving skills.

The motive behind this behavior remains a mystery, and their connection to the conflicting parties requires further observation. ..."

Realizing this, the thugs quickly united, but along with the four-member club calling themselves the 'Gourmet Research Society' who were selling roasted corn nearby, they were all completely wiped out by the Prefect Team Head. Following this engagement, it will be difficult for the thugs to organize another war anytime soon, and the area has temporarily achieved peace. ..."
