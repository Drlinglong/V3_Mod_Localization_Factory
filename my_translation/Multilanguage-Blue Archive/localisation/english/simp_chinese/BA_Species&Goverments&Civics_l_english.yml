 EMPIRE_DESIGN_BA_ETO:0 "Eden Treaty Organization"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_BA_ETO_desc:0 "Way before we even thought about space, the two big academies in Kivotos—Trinity General School and Gehenna Academy—after a lot of back-and-forth, finally signed the 'Eden Treaty'. They set up the Eden Treaty Organization (ETO) to settle the long-standing feuds between the two schools and stop a full-scale war from breaking out.\nEven after that, a bunch of not-so-great stuff happened, but ETO still managed to pull Kivotos together through various means, guiding Kivotos through all the bullet rains and explosions.\nAs we excitedly head out into the unknown, we're totally ready to settle all those old scores too. Because, you know, we're bound to bump into our old rivals out there eventually."
 START_SCREEN_EDEN_TREATY:0 "With a little help from someone we really trusted, we managed to kick the Color right off our home World! Thanks to Trinity General School giving it a big push, we totally re-signed the Eden Treaty. With more and more schools jumping into the treaty, Kivotos could finally chill out and stop fighting. Fast forward a bit, and the Student Council Presidents from the schools that championed the treaty back then formed the new General Student Council. Now that we're looking up at the stars, a super bright future is totally waiting for us!\nBut, like, out in deep space, we're totally gonna bump into our old rivals eventually, aren't we?"

We gave up everything we had to get our freedom back.\nNow, we can finally look past this messed-up World, and try to save this teetering Kivotos after all the mess..."
 START_SCREEN_KYRIE:0 "We once had a sanctuary, where we met, cried, and laughed together. However, consumed by hatred, we trampled our former haven with our own hands, turning it into a sea of flames. With nowhere to return and no one to rely on, we wandered silently among the ruins. No one could have imagined that the starry sky, which we only looked up to in sadness, would become our new home."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_BA_DUU_desc:0 "After Kivotos fell under the assault of the Tower of Vanity, some of our survivors fled to space, using the space stations there as strongholds to preserve our last spark. After overcoming the initial hardships, we took root in space, and new space stations were built one after another. Although there were once oppression, resistance, doubt, and strife, we are now united with a common goal. This tiny spark is about to return home with the power to scorch everything."
 START_SCREEN_UNNAMED:0 "Life in space is vastly different from before; we still long for the days of running and bustling on the land. Our weapons are ready; we are no longer as weak as we once were. Our homeland will not be forgotten just like that. We can't wait to start a new story from this new beginning."
