 BA_crisis.1001.desc:0 "Previously, some of our students tracked a tachyon signal of unknown origin jumping between star systems, but it didn't receive due attention. This signal eventually burst into one of the communication links and seemed to trigger a series of chain reactions within the megastructure.

Some of our students managed to track this tachyon signal and intercepted some information at a relay station within our borders."
