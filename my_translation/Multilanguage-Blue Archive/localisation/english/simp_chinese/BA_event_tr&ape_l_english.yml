 BA_ape.0001.name:0 "Kozeki Ui's Proposal"
 BA_ape.0001.desc:0 "(After Kivotos's reconstruction was complete, Kozeki Ui burrowed back into her beloved library to continue her restoration tasks. Thankfully, the Trinity Library hadn't suffered much damage during the war. While organizing the chaotic books, she discovered something quite special.)\n\n§M“Sensei, I think you really need to see this.”§!\n\n(One morning, a rare sight, she emerged from the Trinity Library and made the long trip to Sensei's office.)"
 BA_ape.0001.a:0 "Oh, a rare guest! Is something the matter?"
 BA_ape.0001.a.re:0 "§M“Yes… Please, take a look at this first.”§!\n(Ui presented a yellowed, ancient scroll.)"
 BA_ape.0001.b:0 "An old book? But this is our interstellar exploration office!"
 BA_ape.0001.b.re:0 "§M“This book… it should have originally been kept in the restricted section. What it describes is related to the Halos above our heads… To be honest, even though the General Student Council previously issued a ban on Halo research, as something so intrinsically linked to us, we know absolutely nothing about their true nature…”§!\n…\n§M“Exactly… I want to initiate some research into Halos.”§!\n…"
 BA_ape.0001.c:0 "...I approve. Just remember to proceed with utmost caution."
 BA_ape.0001.c.re:0 "(After much deliberation, I ultimately decided to approve this proposal.)\nTip: Complete the 'Repair Pyroxene Fabricator' request in the Arona interface. Kozeki Ui will join your leader list as a scientist; please keep an eye out."
 BA_ape.0001.c.tip:0 "Is this truly a bright path, or merely a key to Pandora's Box?"

 BA_ape.0002.name:0 "Kivotos News: A Breakthrough"
 BA_ape.0002.desc:0 "“…Recently, Trinity's ancient text expert, Kozeki Ui, published a groundbreaking thesis: 'A Report on Halos and Divine Seals,' which was publicly defended at the Trinity Grand Cathedral. During the defense, Ui elaborated in detail and comprehensively on her preliminary Halo theory, and presented a malleable material with similar properties to Halos: Fabrication Stone. This thesis was the first to propose various questions regarding the true nature of Halo power."
 BA_ape2.a:0 "Where do we go from here?"

 BA_ape.0003.name:0 "Kivotos News: Fabrication Stone"
 BA_ape.0003.desc:0 "According to a report from Millennium Science School's Engineering Department, during their recent collaborative research with Ms. Kozeki Ui of Trinity, they discovered a synthesis route for Fabrication Stone: using Pyroxene as a raw material, it can also produce some extremely high-quality luxury goods. The Federation Research Department has officially designated it as a key research objective…"
 BA_ape4.a:0 "Fantastic!"

 BA_ape.0004.name:0 "Setback"
 BA_ape.0004.desc:0 "Our research into Halos seems to have hit a bottleneck. Due to missing ancient texts or perhaps the Creator's deliberate obfuscation, it's clear that the path to further unlocking Halo abilities must be found by us. With this lack of data, no one knows how to proceed or where this path might lead.\n\nSpeaking of which, there's still a Gematria outpost left on our homeworld. Since they were conducting Halo-related research, perhaps there are still some research findings left behind in their outpost?"
 BA_ape3.a:0 "Guess we'll just have to try."

 BA_ape.0005.title:0 "Archives"
 BA_ape.0005.desc:0 "Please select the archive you wish to view on the right."
 BA_ape.0005.a:0 "Archive File Alpha-1"
 BA_ape.0005.a.re:0 "Title: Preliminary Determination of Halo Encoding\n\nBody: According to our recent research on samples acquired from the black market, this 'Divine Halo' is essentially something akin to a gene. However, it's not entirely the same as a gene; its expression is also influenced by external factors like will. If DNA is the basic unit of a gene, then the basic unit of a Halo is its 'encoding.' These diverse arrangements of symbols form this perfect work of art, likely a product of some Golden Age civilization, wouldn't you agree?\n\nIt seems the stronger an individual's Halo, the more complex its encoding. If we can decipher the meaning of these encodings, perhaps we can gain complete control over Kivotos."
 BA_ape.0005.b:0 "Archive File Alpha-2"
 BA_ape.0005.b.response:0 "Title: Regarding 'That Power'\n\nBody: We have largely completed the determination of Halo encoding. The next step is to begin modifying Halos. As it stands, we probably can't freely alter Halo encoding data as if we were painting, but we can use powerful forces to forcibly break down some structures. Just as genes mutate under space radiation, Halo encoding can undergo unpredictable changes under the influence of 'Fear.' We don't yet know if this is truly useful; these lower-tier individuals cannot bear the impact of 'Fear.' It seems we need to capture some higher-tier individuals."
 BA_ape.0005.c:0 "Experiment Log - Osiris"
 BA_ape.0005.c.response:0 "Subject: (Data Corrupted)\n\nBody: We attempted to use that power to extract her Halo encoding data from within the Halo. The experiment was successful, but the Halo self-destructed after the encoding was extracted. Modifying Halo encoding was proven feasible, but we couldn't re-import the data, so there's no need to proceed with this method. Fortunately, after losing her Halo, she merely fell into a coma. Given the uniqueness and rarity of this test subject, her body is temporarily preserved in a stasis pod, and her Halo data is stored in a data capsule. We'll redeploy her once we're able to fabricate Halos again."
 BA_ape.0005.d:0 "Experiment Log - Horus"
 BA_ape.0005.d.response:0 "Subject: Takanashi Hoshino\n\nBody: Attempted to directly modify the Halo data, but the effect wasn't very good. Strange, Horus is clearly a very powerful individual; her Halo shouldn't be unable to withstand 'that power.' It seems there was an issue with the experimental method. Although we lost two excellent individuals, we've already selected our next subject: Anubis. We hope the next experiment will be successful."
 BA_ape.0005.f:0 "Any other discoveries?"
 BA_ape.0005.f.response:0 "Just as the archives described, we found Yume Senpai's stasis pod and the data capsule containing her Halo data. I've already informed Takanashi Hoshino."
 BA_ape.0005.g:0 "Close Archives"

 BA_ape.0006.name:0 "Dispute"
 BA_ape.0006.desc:0 "With the completion of the Gematria outpost investigation, we've acquired some… knowledge that's hard to describe. \n\nWe shared the data with the Halo Research Team members, but it seems a dispute erupted among them – one faction represented by Millennium students, and another by Trinity students. \n\nMillennium students advocate for organizing and modifying the data left behind by Gematria, clearly stating: 'That esoteric theory from before was simply too uncontrollable; we must fully master the power of Halos ourselves.'\n\nTrinity students, on the other hand, insist on maintaining reverence for the unknown and highlight that their current theories have already yielded significant results. \n\nThe two sides are at an impasse, and research progress has slowed. Someone with sufficient Influence must make a decision. (Tip: You can ask the current Student Council President for their opinion via the communications panel (though this is not yet implemented).)"
 BA_ape.0006.a:0 "…Anyway, the bickering within the General Student Council is inevitable."

 BA_ape.0007.name:0 "A Choice"
 BA_ape.0007.desc:0 "The prolonged dispute has yielded no results. Clearly, we cannot allow this argument to continue. Until we know when our enemies will return, we don't have much time to dwell on these issues. We must make a choice, no matter what lies ahead on this path."
 BA_ape.0007.a:0 "I need more time to think... (Decide again in 180 days)"
 BA_ape.0007.b:0 "Perhaps we can delve into the true nature of Halos."
 BA_ape.0007.b.tip:0 "Enter the §GHalo Awakening§! path, select the §Y$ap_BA_halo_awaken$§! Ascension Perk to proceed."
 BA_ape.0007.c:0 "We must completely master the power of Halos."

 BA_ape.1001.name:0 "Halo"
 BA_ape.1001.desc:0 "Since our birth, Halos have set us apart from those outside of Kivotos, and the passage of time has made us accustomed to their presence. However, Materialization Studies revealed the interactive nature of Halos, and the rediscovery of Halo Bombs forced us to re-examine their significance. Since Halos are the source of Kivotosians' unique physiology, can we truly unlock even more of their potential? We must do something about this!"
 BA_ape.1001.next:0 "Let's get to it!"

 BA_ape.1002.name:0 "$BA_ape.1001.name$"
 BA_ape.1002.desc:0 "We've completed the Research into Halo Awakening! Hundreds of perfectly successful experiments prove the tech is totally ready now. Halo Awakening isn't even a big surgery; you can get it done at the hospital near the dorms. The thing is, while the discomfort only lasts a few hours, the process itself isn't exactly pleasant (actually, it's super painful!), and for most successful cases, it doesn't really give any obvious benefits. So, maybe we should offer some rewards to encourage as many students as possible to give it a try?"
 BA_ape.1002.Prize0:0 "No rewards! Just make them line up and get it done."
 BA_ape.1002.Prize1:0 "One Exclusive Delicious Stick from the No. 227 Hot Spring Resort."

 BA_ape.1003.Prize1:0 "Preparations for Halo Awakening are complete; we can begin the work. Many students commented that the rewards we prepared were barely better than nothing... However, since the No. 227 Hot Spring Resort no longer exists, those special snack sticks are highly sought after!"
 BA_ape.1003.Prize2:0 "Preparations for Halo Awakening are complete; we can begin the work. The fireworks we're using as rewards for the recipients have sparked quite a buzz on MomoTalk! We took the opportunity to properly educate everyone about the procedure. 'Faust is already impatient,' a prefect whispered to us."
 BA_ape.1003.Prize3:0 "Preparations for Halo Awakening are complete; we can begin the work. [Root.GetRulerName] has publicly protested our infringement on their likeness, sparking some condemnation and a lot of absolutely unhinged comments among the public. Rumor has it that the prices for a small number of figurines that leaked to the black market early have already skyrocketed to unbelievable numbers!"
 BA_ape.1003.Prize4:0 "Preparations for Halo Awakening are complete; we can begin the work. Our budget really made the General Student Council bleed, but the accessories we handed out quickly took over all the headlines, generating a huge amount of excitement! No doubt, this work will go super smoothly."

 BA_ape.1004.desc:0 "The Halo Awakening work is pretty much done! While most students' Halos haven't changed much in appearance, their brightness got a tiny boost.

 BA_ape.2000.desc:0 "Sensei, the Academy City World totally can't support interstellar travel needs anymore, and there's serious waste when it comes to land and resources...\nOf course, all sorts of renovation plans have been proposed already! Some suggest tearing everything down and rebuilding, others recommend learning from those Fallen Empires...\nAh, Sensei, you probably don't think those suggestions are feasible, right?\nBut, Arona's favorite is *this* plan! It proposes different directional outlines for each type of district. After the modifications, district efficiency almost doubles, but the construction cost barely changes! It's so incredible, right?! The downsides? Well, of course, there are some... According to this plan, each area will need a different modification project..."
 BA_ape.2000.a:0 "No problem, let's go with this plan."
 BA_ape.2000.a.re:0 "...Huh, that's going to be a pretty big expense, and lots of places full of everyone's memories will be covered up...\n§BHistory and Memories, and let's compile a Chronicle while we're at it§!... right? Hmm, yes, we really should do that, Sensei. Getting swept up in the past and forgetting the future isn't our style, after all. So, let's pick a date to tell everyone about this, okay? We'll have everyone work together on both the modifications and the Chronicle!"
