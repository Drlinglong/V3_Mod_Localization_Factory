 Hoshino_chat.6:0 "Ah, Misono Mika from Trinity General School, she's really easy to get along with, even if she doesn't have much experience managing a school."
 Hoshino_chat.6.a:0 "Actually, she's quite violent in private (like punching through walls with her bare hands)."
 Hoshino_chat.7:0 "Sensei, do you prefer flat chests, or do you hate big ones?"
 Hoshino_chat.7.a:0 "Of course, I prefer flat chests!"
 Hoshino_chat.7.b:0 "Big breasts are a bad civilization!"
 Hoshino_chat.7.c:0 "Why not just like Hoshino directly, then?"
 Hoshino_chat.7.d:0 "Wait a minute... Is something wrong here?"
 Hoshino_chat.8:0 "See? Sensei is on my side after all."
 Hoshino_chat.8.a:0 "(Hmm, I guess there wasn't really a choice, huh? Oh well, better not call Hoshino out on it.)"
 Hoshino_chat.9:0 "W-what...? Sensei, don't just say things that'll cause misunderstandings!"
 Hoshino_chat.9.a:0 "You didn't even give me an option, did you?"
 Hoshino_chat.10:0 "Uh, your ol' Hoshino doesn't know anything, okay~?"
 Hoshino_chat.10.a:0 "Hoshino, you did that on purpose, didn't you?"
 Hoshino_event:0 "Hoshino, I have something special for you... Do you have time tomorrow?"
 Hoshino_event.tip:0 "No way~ We're in a teacher-student relationship.jpg"
 Hoshino_coffee:0 "(Using an Invitation Ticket to lure her to the Cafe for some serious head-patting.)"
 coffee_cooldown:0 "Cafe Invitation Ticket on cooldown."

 BA_Hoshino_exit:0 "Nothing much, just came to see you."

 Hina:0 "Sorasaki Hina"
 Hina_desc1:0 "(As I entered the student council president's office, Hina was buried in paperwork. Noticing my presence, she looked up.)\nAh, Sensei, I can handle these files myself."
 Hina_about_now:0 "Discuss current progress with Hina"
 Hina_about_now.tip:0 "Get some advice for game progress."
 Hina_about_now.1:0 "Sensei, when planning development, you should also pay attention to Job allocation. No one ever wants to do the low-level work, and the students' Pop growth is slow. If there are Job shortages, perhaps you could consider developing Robot Workers. Well, in the end, it's still up to you to decide, Sensei."
 Hina_about_now.2:0 "Shizuko from the Festival Operations Department at Hyakkiyako has submitted requests to open branch offices more than once, but our system is already full of them! Perhaps Sensei could consider letting them open branches on Worlds belonging to other galactic civilizations."
 Hina_chat:0 "Chat with Hina"
 Hina_chat.tip:0 "But Hina is still working... though I don't think Hina would refuse."
 Hina_chat.1:0 "Work, huh... It's really nothing. After all, I took on this duty myself, and I got used to it during my time on the Prefect Team.\n(But I still really want Sensei to praise me...)"
 Hina_chat.1.a:0 "Hina needs to take care of herself too."
 Hina_chat.2:0 "Sensei, you can just focus on external affairs. With me in charge here in Kivotos, those problematic students won't be able to stir up any trouble."
 Hina_chat.2.a:0 "Hina is so reliable!"
 Hina_chat.3:0 "Takanashi Hoshino, huh... The way she's changed so much, I wonder if something happened to her..."
 Hina_chat.3.a:0 "After all, she's an important student to me. I'll keep a close eye on her too."
 Hina_chat.4:0 "Who's stronger, me or Misono Mika? Sensei, are you an elementary schooler to be bothered by such a question...?"
 Hina_chat.4.a:0 "Just curious, that's all."
 BA_Hina_exit:0 "Then I won't disturb you, Hina."



 Mika:0 "Misono Mika"
 Mika_desc:0 "(Mika, in the holographic projection, looked a little tired, but the weariness on her face was quickly swept away by a brilliant smile.)\nSensei! Mika's been diligently learning how to handle administrative duties! There have been so many communications from all sorts of Worlds and academies lately, but I've set a special ringtone for Sensei so you don't have to worry about me missing your calls! So, is there anything Mika can help Sensei with today?"
 Mika_about_now:0 "Ask Mika for her thoughts on the current situation."
 Mika_about_now.tip:0 "Get some advice for game progress."
 Mika_about_now.1:0 "It's been so long since I've seen Nagisa-chan and Seia-chan! Even though we chat on Momotalk every day, I really miss having tea parties with them. The student council has also received a lot of complaints about this, especially from the students in charge of colonizing remote Worlds. Sensei, don't forget about their Amenities issues! When you're up high like I used to be, there are still many things you can't see clearly."
 Mika_about_now.2:0 "Alien beings... many of them don't seem very pleasant. But perhaps some of that is just my prejudice, like how I used to feel about Gehenna. If we can get along with them, it might help Kivotos's long-term development in the future."
 Mika_about_now.3:0 "Sensei, don't forget about the students in flexible employment on all the colonies! While there won't be unemployment in Kivotos, it's clearly a better choice for students to each have their own assigned Job."
 Mika_about_now.4:0 "Uwah, I wish I had a helper like Arona, just like Sensei! Look, doesn't Sorasaki-san also have an official by her side...? Dealing with mountains of files every day really makes you physically and mentally exhausted. Eh? Sensei could come help? Wouldn't that be too biased? Although... it wouldn't be so bad..."
 Mika_about_now.5:0 "Being the student council president is tiring, but at least all the privileges that were suspended by the hearing are back now, and my authority is even greater... But it's only now that I understand how terrifying equal responsibility is. So Nagisa-chan handled all these things for me back then? Sensei, you must have a lot of clubs to deal with too, so remember to send them their activity funds! After all, all the student council can really do is interact with the academy officials."
 Mika_about_now.6:0 "The Defense Department keeps submitting requests for military expansion. If possible, Sensei, could you please urge the Engineering Department to develop new weapons? After all, simply expanding the fleet can only do so much."
 Mika_chat:0 "Chat with Mika"
 Mika_chat.tip:0 "Perhaps Mika prefers spending time with Sensei more than working."
 Mika_chat.1:0 "Takanashi Hoshino? I don't know her very well, but I heard she single-handedly supported a school that was almost abandoned. I saw her during a Defense Department meeting before; her eyes didn't match her lazy appearance at all. I've seen a similar look in Ikashino Misaki's eyes before; it's something only people with strong convictions deep inside possess. I suppose her conviction comes from past regrets. In a way, she and I have something in common."
 Mika_chat.1.a:0 "Everyone has their own path, and their own unique salvation."
 Mika_chat.2:0 "Sorasaki-san also attended the previous Defense Department meeting. Even though she's as petite as Seia-chan, she seems like a very responsible type. It also looked like she had a very capable official with her, didn't she? But for someone as strong as her, she could probably solve most problems herself... Could it be that Sensei likes reliable girls like that?"
 Mika_chat.2.a:0 "Mika has made great progress since becoming student council president, but I hope Mika will just be herself."
 Mika_chat.3:0 "The former accountant of Seminar, the first governor after Kivotos entered a new era, the cold calculator – that's basically all the information I could get. Hayase-san's management reports have way too much data! I often get dizzy just looking at them! I've told her more than once to provide less raw data and more converted reports, but all she replies with is that perfectly calculated data is the most accurate reflection of reality. Don't you think long strings of numbers have no aesthetic appeal, Sensei...?"
 Mika_chat.3.a:0 "This is also part of the job, Mika. You need to learn to overcome difficulties at work. It's part of becoming independent."
 Mika_chat.4:0 "Eh... Sensei's got some free time, huh...? If that's the case, why don't you just come directly to the General Student Council to find me? It'd be great if we could invite Nagisa-chan and Seia-chan for a tea party too; I can't even remember the last time the four of us had tea together. But if Sensei wants to come alone... I'd be very happy to welcome you too, you know."
 Mika_chat.4.a:0 "Maybe after I've finished everything on my plate."

 BA_Mika_exit:0 "Well then, I'll be going now."



 Yuuka:0 "Hayase Yuuka"
 Yuuka_desc1:0 "Let me see... this month's budget for all of Kivotos is... military expenditures are... diplomatic spending isn't small either... and economic subsidies for each academy... Ah, Sensei! Welcome! My apologies, I was just too absorbed, so I couldn't free up my hands. But, I\tcan solve your problems while I work, please go ahead."
 Yuuka_about_now:0 "Ask Yuuka for her thoughts on the current situation."
 Yuuka_about_now.tip:0 "Get some advice for game progress."
 Yuuka_about_now.1:0 "To become a truly responsible adult, Sensei, you'll need to always keep a close eye on our finances! Of course, that doesn't just mean [Concept('energy_credits', 'Energy Credits')], but also paying special attention to the income of all our other resources. You can manage gains and losses through market and diplomatic [Concept('trade', 'Trade')], and also efficiently extract necessary resources by thoughtfully assigning everyone's [Concept('job', 'Jobs')]. Oh, and I recommend you properly deal with any resources our warehouses can't accommodate, okay? Wastefulness, just like unlimited spending, is quite irresponsible. But since I'm the Student Council President, with me here, I'm sure you'll be fine!"
 Yuuka_about_now.2:0 "In between tasks, Sensei, why not pay attention to everyone's daily activities? Many students have already sent applications to the Student Council to build club branches. While the Student Council has already approved the relevant [Concept('resolution', 'resolutions')], the specific details are still up to you to decide, okay?"
 Yuuka_chat:0 "Talk with Hayase Yuuka"
 Yuuka_chat.tip:0 "Hayase Yuuka might be a total workaholic, but a little chat with Sensei couldn't hurt."
 Yuuka_chat.1:0 "Work, huh...? Ahaha, it's really nothing much. When I was the accountant for Seminar, the workload wasn't any less than this. Dealing with all sorts of strange proposals, and then helping President Rio clean up after everything... Now that I'm the Student Council President, I actually feel less constrained. It's not necessarily a bad thing, you know. (And... this way, I'm a little closer to Sensei...)"
 Yuuka_chat.1.a:0 "Even so, Hayase Yuuka should really get more rest."
 Yuuka_chat.2:0 "Having previously taken on President Rio's duties in Seminar, handling matters within Kivotos is no problem for me. So please, feel free to turn your gaze to the cosmos! Oh, and of course, I can handle diplomatic affairs too! Please don't hold back your requests, okay?"
 Yuuka_chat.2.a:0 "As expected of Hayase Yuuka, always so reliable."
 Yuuka_chat.3:0 "Sorasaki Hina, Head of Gehenna Academy's Prefect Team... Is she the Hina you often mention to Aris? Aris often talks about her to me too, she really is a very dependable person... Sigh, why can't C&C learn from her...?"
 Yuuka_chat.3.a:0 "Hayase Yuuka, please look after the Prefect Team Head."
 Yuuka_chat.4:0 "Takanashi Hoshino? Ah, she's the Vice President from Abydos, isn't she...? She's quite an enigmatic person. Noa always tells me that beneath her relaxed demeanor, there's a hint of worry and trouble... I suppose she must have gone through something significant."
 Yuuka_chat.4.a:0 "Let's hope that doesn't happen again."
 BA_Yuuka_exit:0 "I won't keep you from your work, Hayase Yuuka, okay?"
