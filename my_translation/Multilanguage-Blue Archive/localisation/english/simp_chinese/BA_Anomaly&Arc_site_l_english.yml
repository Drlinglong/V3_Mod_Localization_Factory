 BA_anomaly_Dgate:0 "Dangerous Signal"
 BA_anomaly_Dgate_desc:0 "Our Science Ship detected some extremely dangerous anomalous signals and traces of unusual matter on a World within the Comm-Link Interface System."

 BA_Dgate_arc_site:0 "Pioneer Battlefield"
 BA_Dgate_arc_site_desc_RAID01:0 "Wearing the new Gematria Wave Protection Suits developed by the Engineering Club, our explorers and research team finally landed safely on this World. The moment we arrived, many of our research instruments went haywire and broke down from excessive readings! [Root.GetLeaderName] believes that this World's Dimensional Distortion has reached almost 100%, making recovery practically impossible. At this point, our explorers and research team are even more desperate to find out what exactly happened on this World."

 BA_Dgate_arc_site_desc_RAID02:0 "Our explorers and research team trek across the highly distorted land, constantly worrying if the ground beneath their feet might give way due to the Dimensional Distortion. Equipped with various exploration methods, everyone finally managed to safely enter a building that was relatively well-preserved compared to other ruins. Its style looked somewhat similar to the architecture we have in Kivotos! Research Team Leader [Root.GetLeaderName] accidentally stumbled upon a control console and was surprised to find it still powered by reserve energy. [Root.GetLeaderName] quickly activated it and, as it booted up, immediately hacked into the system, gaining control and opening the path to the lower levels of the building. The moment it opened, everyone was absolutely stunned! The entire underground passage seemed to lead to another World, even though it was still largely distorted by Gematria waves, tearing the passage into ragged pieces. Yet, through this shattered state, it was clear that compared to the barren surface outside and buildings pockmarked by years of planetary winds, the underground passage and its extensions were wide and clean, just as a high-tech facility should be! [Root.GetLeaderName] bravely stepped inside, determined to uncover how many Gematria secrets were hidden within this subterranean space."

 BA_Dgate_arc_site_desc_RAID03:0 "Our explorers and research team deeply regretted this rash undertaking. They had endured endless cycles of 'dark door' and 'open door' operations within these underground passages, as if navigating a vast subterranean labyrinth. The life support devices for the distorted environment needed constant replacement, forcing them to repeatedly revisit this underground tunnel, each trip exposing them to further erosion. Ultimately, through Research Team Leader [Root.GetLeaderName]'s tireless efforts, a seemingly crucial door was finally cracked open. But the sight that greeted them the moment it opened left them even more stunned... Countless rifles, shattered physical Halos. Humanoid figures and black, viscous body parts were strewn everywhere, intact just as they had imagined. 'What in the world is going on here...' Research Team Leader [Root.GetLeaderName] and the team took a long moment to compose themselves outside the door before slowly stepping in to face this reality. 'Students were here, fighting to the death in what looks like a Gematria infrastructure hub...' Research Team Leader [Root.GetLeaderName] surveyed the surroundings, spotting many upright computer-like devices leading via a conduit to a large central console in the room. 'Why are students here? Shouldn't this be a Gematria base? What is going on?' Filled with confusion, helplessness, and dread, XXX attempted to activate the central main console's system. 'If the main hall had backup energy to power the underground space's door, then there must be reserve power here too, enough for me to activate this darn central hub and find out what's what!'"
 BA_Dgate_arc_site_option_RAID03:0 "..."
 BA_Dgate_arc_site_desc_RAID04:0 "After a series of complex activation experiments, [Root.GetLeaderName] finally brought the central hub online. Following some basic hacking, [Root.GetLeaderName] uncovered the device's last recorded log before shutdown. 'Report, a large number of unidentified vessels have arrived near the World. Target vessels are deploying drop pods onto the World.' 'Can you identify them?' 'They appear to be students. Students?' 'Students? Students! Impossible, how would students find their way here?' 'They are indeed students.' (Static crackles) 'Hello? Hello? It's gone bad, report to the higher-ups immediately!' 'Um, we don't seem to be able to send messages outside?' 'What... have their capabilities become so advanced that they've locked down all communications on this entire World? Damn it, why are they attacking here... could it be!' 'Warning, warning, drop pods have landed safely. Initial landing coordinates sent. Students have also established a command center at the landing site. Awaiting instructions.' 'Nothing to instruct, retreat immediately and hold the underground passages, await reinforcements!'............'That's it?' [Root.GetLeaderName] muttered. [Root.GetLeaderName] had worked tirelessly for half a day, only to recover this single command log. It seemed the central hub's system had been thoroughly wiped clean. Who were these students in the log? Our empire has no record of invading this World whatsoever, nor did we even know this system had Gematria comm-links before, or that such a World, once belonging to Gematria, existed within it. What in the world is going on? After much deliberation, [Root.GetLeaderName] suddenly remembered something. 'Coordinates!'"
 BA_Dgate_arc_site_option_RAID04:0 "..."
 BA_Dgate_arc_site_desc_RAID05:0 "Led by Research Team Leader [Root.GetLeaderName], the explorers and research team followed the coordinates to their designated address: a temporary command center. There, they discovered some very familiar items. Armored vehicles and central computers with communication systems configured in a style similar to Kivotos, alongside transportation and support equipment with a distinct Kivotos flair. There was even an area resembling a medical department, with a sign that read 'Remedial Knights' Medical Camp'. Seeing these things, the explorers and research team were stunned and began to question everything. 'If *they* were students? Then who are *we*? We didn't do this.' [Root.GetLeaderName] couldn't suppress their thirst for the truth and charged ahead alone, separating from the group. When the others found [Root.GetLeaderName], they saw them carefully operating a machine inside a severely corroded room. 'The Pioneers,' [Root.GetLeaderName] stated. 'They were called the Pioneers. They are us, and yet not us. They commanded this battle, invaded this system and this World, all for the sole purpose of seizing one thing from this World, regardless of casualties...' 'The 'key' to open a link channel and directly enter the Gematria Dimensional System – which is Gematria's headquarters...' 'They endured immense hardship, using Pioneer technology to develop themselves, growing strong enough for this very moment: to counterattack Gematria, attempting to destroy Gematria's central zone to sever its ties with external Gematria forces. Of course, they knew that if this attack failed, it would obliterate all of the Pioneers' grand prospects in the universe. But for their own sake, they ultimately chose to attack this system. And of course, they succeeded...'"
